# Samay v6 - Multi-AI Automation Extension
## Complete Project Status Report - August 3rd, 2025

---

## 📋 **Project Overview**

**Samay v6** is a browser extension-based multi-AI automation system that allows users to submit queries simultaneously across multiple AI services (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity) and receive synthesized responses. This represents a complete architectural shift from previous versions, moving from a native desktop approach to a zero-API-cost browser extension solution.

### **Core Architecture**
- **Frontend**: React.js web application (localhost:3000)
- **Backend**: FastAPI with simplified mode (health endpoints, WebSocket support)
- **Extension**: Chrome Manifest V3 with content scripts and background service worker
- **Communication**: Bridge-based messaging system between web app and extension
- **Automation**: Service-specific automation scripts for each AI platform

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATUS: MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**

### **✅ Successfully Completed: Query Submission Phase**
As of the latest testing session, **all four AI services are receiving and processing queries successfully**:

- **ChatGPT**: ✅ Query submitted successfully
- **Claude**: ✅ Query submitted successfully  
- **Gemini**: ✅ Query submitted successfully
- **Perplexity**: ✅ Query submitted successfully

### **Extension Status Dashboard**
- **Automation Status**: Running ✅
- **Individual Services**: Showing as "idle" (expected - responses not yet collected)
- **Communication Bridge**: Functional with fallback mechanisms
- **Background Orchestration**: Active and coordinating

---

## 🔧 **CURRENT ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **1. Extension Context Invalidation**
```
Uncaught Error: Extension context invalidated.
```
- **Cause**: Extension reload during active automation
- **Impact**: Breaks ongoing automation processes
- **Priority**: High

### **2. Input Handling Edge Cases**
```
Could not clear input: TypeError: input.select is not a function
```
- **Cause**: `input.select()` not supported on contentEditable elements
- **Impact**: Minor - fallback clearing methods exist
- **Priority**: Medium

### **3. Perplexity Response Collection**
```
Perplexity response timeout details: [object Object]
```
- **Cause**: Improved selectors needed for response detection
- **Impact**: Service marked as failed despite potential success
- **Priority**: High

### **4. Response Extraction Gap**
- **Current State**: Services show "idle" after query submission
- **Missing Component**: Response collection and data relay system
- **Impact**: No response data returned to web app
- **Priority**: Critical (Next Phase)

## 🚀 **NEXT PHASE: RESPONSE EXTRACTION & DATA FLOW**

### **User's Modularization Proposal (EXCELLENT SUGGESTION)**

The user has proposed a modular architecture that separates automation concerns:

```
automation/
├── orchestrator.js          # Main coordination
├── query_injection/         # Stage 1: Writing prompts ✅ DONE
│   ├── chatgpt_injector.js
│   ├── claude_injector.js
│   ├── gemini_injector.js
│   └── perplexity_injector.js
├── response_extraction/     # Stage 2: Collecting responses 🔄 NEXT
│   ├── chatgpt_extractor.js
│   ├── claude_extractor.js
│   ├── gemini_extractor.js
│   └── perplexity_extractor.js
├── follow_up/              # Stage 3: Follow-up questions (optional)
│   └── follow_up_manager.js
└── data_relay/             # Stage 4: Send back to web app
    └── response_collector.js
```

### **Benefits of This Approach**
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each file handles one specific automation stage
2. **Service-Specific Optimizations**: Tailored extractors for each AI service's unique DOM
3. **Easier Debugging**: Isolate issues to specific stages and services
4. **Parallel Development**: Work on multiple services simultaneously
5. **Modular Testing**: Test injection and extraction independently
6. **Better Error Handling**: Stage-specific error recovery and fallbacks

## 🛠 **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DETAILS**

### **Communication Flow**
```
[React Web App] ←→ [Bridge Script] ←→ [Content Script] ←→ [Background Script] ←→ [AI Services]
```

### **Data Structures**

#### **Session Object**
```javascript
{
  sessionId: "session_1691234567890_abc123",
  query: "User's original query",
  timestamp: "2025-08-03T10:30:00Z",
  services: ["chatgpt", "claude", "gemini", "perplexity"],
  status: "running" | "completed" | "error"
}
```

#### **Service Response Object**
```javascript
{
  service: "chatgpt",
  content: "AI response text...",
  timestamp: "2025-08-03T10:32:15Z",
  wordCount: 247,
  success: true,
  metadata: {
    responseTime: 45000,
    partial: false,
    citations: []
  }
}
```

### **Error Handling Strategy**
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue with available services if others fail
- **Partial Response Collection**: Return incomplete but useful data
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retry for transient failures
- **Timeout Management**: Service-specific timeout configurations
- **Fallback Communication**: Bridge → Direct Chrome API → Manual detection
