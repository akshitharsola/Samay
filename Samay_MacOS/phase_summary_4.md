## Technical Implementation Details

### UI Architecture Improvements
```swift
// Enhanced message display with proper contrast
Text(message.content)
    .font(.system(size: 14, design: .default))
    .foregroundColor(.primary)
    .textSelection(.enabled)
    .background(
        RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12)
            .fill(message.role == .user ? 
                  Color.blue.opacity(0.08) : 
                  Color(.controlBackgroundColor))
    )

// Auto-scroll implementation
.onChange(of: llmManager.conversationHistory.count) {
    if let lastMessage = llmManager.conversationHistory.last {
        withAnimation(.easeOut(duration: 0.3)) {
            proxy.scrollTo(lastMessage.id, anchor: .bottom)
        }
    }
}
```

### Authentication System Fixes
```swift
// Modern NSWorkspace API usage
private func launchApp(bundleId: String) async {
    let workspace = NSWorkspace.shared
    if let appURL = workspace.urlForApplication(withBundleIdentifier: bundleId) {
        let configuration = NSWorkspace.OpenConfiguration()
        configuration.activates = true
        do {
            try await workspace.openApplication(at: appURL, configuration: configuration)
        } catch {
            print("Failed to launch app with bundle ID \(bundleId): \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```
