# Building a Multi-Agent AI Assistant on a MacBook Air M2

_Free Hugging Face LLMs + Claude Code + Local Apple Silicon GPU_

The following guide how to architect, install, program, and extend a personal “Jarvis-style” assistant that mediates between you and Anthropic’s Claude coding model while also handling day-to-day tasks locally. All components are chosen to run at zero or near-zero cost on a MacBook Air M2 and to remain vendor-agnostic by using open-source models from Hugging Face and LangChain’s multi-agent framework.

## Overview

Modern Apple Silicon laptops can host 4-bit-quantized 3 B–8 B language models entirely on-device, while heavier reasoning or code-generation turns can be off-loaded to Claude through a lightweight proxy service. By chaining these pieces into a supervisors-and-workers graph, you obtain:

- A free, locally running “brain” for fast queries and offline work (e.g., Phi-3-Mini, Gemma-2B, Mistral-7B in Q4) [^1_1][^1_2][^1_3].
- A cloud bridge that rewrites your natural-language programming intentions into concise, machine-readable prompts for Claude, then post-processes the API response for readability [^1_4][^1_5][^1_6].
- Tool wrappers (shell, Spotlight, browser automation, HomeKit, etc.) registered as LangChain agents so your assistant can execute macOS actions on command [^1_7][^1_8].

The result is an extensible, multi-persona system that costs <\$3 month in Claude API calls under typical hobbyist usage and nothing when fully offline.

## Hardware \& OS Baseline

### MacBook Air M2 specs (relevant excerpts)

| Component | Key figures |
| :-- | :-- |
| CPU / GPU | 8-core CPU, 8- or 10-core GPU  [^1_9] |
| Neural Engine | 16-core [^1_9] |
| Unified Memory | 8 GB default; up to 24 GB  [^1_9] |
| Memory BW | 100 GB/s [^1_9] |

A 7 GB quantized GGUF file such as Mistral-7B-Q4_0 sits comfortably in 8 GB RAM when you off-load ≥1 layer to the 8-core GPU via Metal [^1_10][^1_11]. If you own the 16 GB or 24 GB configuration, an 8 B or even 14 B model runs entirely in RAM without swap [^1_12][^1_13].

## Selecting Free Hugging Face LLMs

| Model family | Params | Context | Quant Size (Q4 _K_M) | Strengths | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Phi-3-Mini | 3.8 B | 4,096 tokens [^1_1][^1_14] | 2.1 GB | Reasoning benchmarks; small RAM | Ideal default brain |
| Gemma-2B | 2.5 B effective [^1_15] | 8,192 tokens [^1_2] | 1.4 GB | Fast, open-weights, safety tooling [^1_16] | Use for quick lookups |
| Mistral-7B Instruct | 7.0 B | 4,096 tokens [^1_3] | 4.4 GB | Conversational fluency | Needs 8 GB+ RAM |
| Llama-3 8B | 8.03 B [^1_17] | 8,192 tokens [^1_18] | 4.7 GB | High-quality reasoning | 16 GB RAM recommended |

All four are license-permissive and have free inference quotas via Hugging Face TGI or serverless endpoints [^1_19][^1_20].

## Local Serving on Apple Silicon

1. **Install llama.cpp**:

```bash
brew install ggml-org/llama.cpp/llama.cpp  # auto-enables Metal GPU
```

_(Brew build uses `GGML_METAL=ON` by default [^1_21])_.
2. **Download a Q4 model**:

```bash
ollama run phi3:mini-4k
```

Ollama bundles Metal acceleration and acts as an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server [^1_22][^1_13].
3. **Run as a background service**:

```bash
ollama serve
export OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
```

4. **Benchmark**: Expect 12–18 tokens s⁻¹ on an 8 core GPU for Phi-3 and 6–9 tokens s⁻¹ for Mistral-7B Q4 [^1_23][^1_11].

## Remote Fallback: Claude 3.5 Sonnet

Claude 3.5 Sonnet exposes a 200 k token context window (inputs) and 4,096 token generation limit (outputs) [^1_24][^1_25]. The first \$5 credit is free after SMS verification [^1_6]. Add a request header to unlock 8,192 output tokens:

```http
POST /v1/messages
anthropic-beta: max-tokens-3-5-sonnet-2024-07-15
```

_Work-around avoids the older 4,096 validator bug in AWS Bedrock [^1_26][^1_27]._

Pricing at \$3 M⁻¹ input tokens and \$15 M⁻¹ output tokens means a 1,000-token round-trip costs ≈\$0.018.

## System Architecture

### High-level Graph (LangGraph notation)

```mermaid
graph TD
  U(User) --> R(Resident LLM)
  U -->|Code request| P(Proxy Agent)
  R -->|Fast answer OR delegate| P
  P -->|Rewrite prompt| C(Claude API)
  C --> P
  P -->|Post-process| R
  R --> U
  R -.tool.->|macOS actions| T(Toolbox)
```

1. **Resident LLM** (Phi-3) handles small talk, offline Q\&A, and writes chain-of-thought stubs [^1_14][^1_13].
2. **Proxy Agent** rewrites high-level coding requests into terse “machine language” for Claude [^1_4][^1_8].
3. **Claude** returns compilable code; the proxy strips escape sequences and feeds back to the resident model for summarization [^1_5][^1_6].
4. **Toolbox** exposes shell, Spotlight, Automator, HomeKit, and Browser methods as JSON-schema tools callable via LangChain’s ReAct agent [^1_7][^1_8].

## Prompt Engineering Blueprint

| Phase | System prompt snippet | Purpose |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Resident LLM | “You are Swift-Lite, a fast offline assistant. For large code or deep reasoning, reply ONLY with `DELEGATE:` + a one-sentence summary.” | Triggers routing |
| Proxy Agent → Claude | “Act as a senior macOS developer. Translate the user story into minimal, well-commented Swift code. Respond with triple-back-ticked blocks only.” | Clairity |
| Claude → Proxy | N/A (Claude’s output) | Code + |
| chain-of-thought remains hidden |  |  |
| Proxy → Resident | `CODE:` followed by cleaned code; `SUMMARY:` concise explainer | Consistent UI |

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Python environment

```bash
brew install pyenv && pyenv install 3.11.9
pyenv virtualenv 3.11.9 jarvis-env
pyenv activate jarvis-env
pip install langchain langgraph langchain_huggingface langchain_anthropic llama-cpp-python[server] ollama
```

`llama-cpp-python` v0.1.68 adds Metal GPU by default [^1_10].

### 2. Load local model

```python
from langchain_community.llms import LlamaCpp
llm_local = LlamaCpp(
    model_path="~/Library/Application Support/ollama/models/phi3-mini-4k.Q4_K_M.gguf",
    n_gpu_layers=1,
    n_ctx=4096,
    temperature=0.3,
)
```


### 3. Define Claude client

```python
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
llm_claude = ChatAnthropic(
    model_name="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
    anthropic_api_key=os.getenv("CLAUDE_KEY"),
    extra_headers={"anthropic-beta": "max-tokens-3-5-sonnet-2024-07-15"},
)
```


### 4. Build LangGraph router

```python
import langgraph

def route(node_state):
    if node_state["text"].startswith("DELEGATE:"):
        return "proxy"
    return "resident"

graph = langgraph.Graph()
graph.add_node("resident", llm_local)
graph.add_node("proxy", llm_claude)
graph.set_entry_point("resident")
graph.add_edge("resident", route)
graph.add_edge("proxy", "resident")
assistant = graph.compile()
```


### 5. Register macOS tools

```python
from langchain.tools import Tool
import subprocess, webbrowser, os, json

def open_url(url:str):
    webbrowser.open(url)
    return "Opened " + url

def run_shell(cmd:str):
    out = subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True, text=True)
    return out[:2_000]

tools = [
    Tool.from_function(run_shell, name="shell", description="Run safe shell commands"),
    Tool.from_function(open_url, name="browser", description="Open a URL"),
]
```

Attach tools to the graph via ReAct [^1_7].

## Voice I/O (Optional)

- **STT**: Use Apple Speech framework via `pyobjc` for offline dictation.
- **TTS**: `say` CLI or Apple Neural TTS for multilingual output.
- Connect microphone events to `assistant.invoke()`; stream responses through TTS.


## Persistence \& Memory

1. **Short-term**: LangChain’s `ConversationBufferMemory` keeps the last N interactions in RAM.
2. **Long-term facts**: Store embeddings in SQLite using `duckdb + pgvector` or `Chroma` referencing user notes.
3. **Code base context**: Claude already handles 200 k tokens; for local models, chunk files and feed on demand.

## Security \& Privacy

- Keep Claude API key in macOS Keychain.
- Gate any `shell` or `sudo` call behind an explicit user confirmation prompt via SwiftDialog.
- Add ShieldGemma classifiers locally to screen user inputs and model outputs for policy violations [^1_16].


## Cost \& Performance Table

| Operation | Local tokens | Time (M2 8-core GPU) | Claude tokens | Cloud cost |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Quick Q\&A | 50 | 0.25 s | 0 | \$0 |
| Medium explanation | 300 | 2 s | 0 | \$0 |
| Code generation | 200 deleg. | 1 s rewrite + 3 s Claude | 1,200 | \$0.018 [^1_6] |
| Full project scaffold | 1,000 deleg. | 3 s + 12 s Claude | 5,000 | \$0.09 |

At <50 k Claude tokens per month, total bill ≈\$0.75.

## Testing Matrix

| Scenario | Expected Router | Pass criteria |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| “What’s 7 × 13?” | Local | <0.5 s answer |
| “Generate a SwiftUI view for a login screen.” | Proxy → Claude | Compilable code |
| “Open apple.com” | Local + tool call | Browser launches |
| “Shut down in 15 min” | Local + shell | Schedules `shutdown -h +15` |

## Common Pitfalls \& Fixes

| Symptom | Likely cause | Remedy |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| “Cannot mmap model” | Not enough RAM | Use Phi-3 Mini Q4 or off-load fewer GPU layers |
| Claude error “max_tokens 4096” | Missing header | Add `anthropic-beta` header [^1_26] |
| Tool hallucinations | ReAct agent lacks outcome checks | Add guardrails that parse tool JSON and validate fields |
| Slow local decoding | Default `n_gpu_layers=0` | Set `n_gpu_layers=1` or more [^1_10] |

## Extending the Assistant

1. **GitOps**: Integrate `gitpython` tool for commit, push, PR creation.
2. **HomeKit**: Expose JSON tool to call `pyhap` for smart-home control.
3. **RAG**: Add directory-watcher that chunks PDF/Markdown into Chroma and routes queries to a retrieval-augmented chain.
4. **Vision**: Pipe clipboard images through Phi-3-Vision or Claude-Vision once released.

## Conclusion

By pairing a lightweight on-device brain (Phi-3, Gemma, or Mistral) with a specialized cloud coder (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and orchestrating them through LangGraph, you achieve a responsive, privacy-respecting personal assistant on a MacBook Air M2. The workflow combines zero-cost local inference, GPU acceleration via Metal, and pay-as-you-go heavy lifting only when needed. With modular agents and Hugging Face’s ever-growing catalog of free models, your 2025 “Jarvis” evolves as quickly as the open-source ecosystem itself.

## Insights on a More Intelligent "Jarvis" Workflow for Claude Pro Users

Your vision—where your assistant mediates with Claude, detects unsatisfactory results, and intelligently retries or clarifies—reflects a new level of automation and quality control in AI-powered work. Below are some key thoughts and conceptual building blocks for such an assistant, with a focus on information and design rather than implementation:

### 1. **Automated Output Validation and Feedback Loop**

- The assistant can act as a *reviewer* of Claude’s output by:
    - Comparing the actual response against your explicitly stated requirements or expected format.
    - Automatically identifying missing elements, discrepancies in content, or incorrect structures.
    - Triggering additional queries to Claude that clarify, refine, or complete the original output until the desired standard is achieved.
- This "auto-retry" loop bridges the gap between your intent and the model’s first response, potentially reducing back-and-forth and manual editing.


### 2. **Structured Communication Layer**

- Before forwarding your request to Claude, the assistant can:
    - Parse and formalize your instructions (inputs, expected outputs, formatting rules, constraints).
    - Generate a detailed checklist or structured rubric that both Claude and itself use to evaluate completeness and accuracy.
- This structure can be customized based on the context (e.g., code generation, explanations, project management tasks).


### 3. **Personalized Context and Intent Awareness**

- The assistant can leverage previous interactions, your preferred coding or work style, and domain knowledge to:
    - Remind Claude (or itself in local processing) of recurring mistakes or preferences.
    - Adapt its evaluation criteria based on the type of task—e.g., code correctness, answer exhaustiveness, adherence to a particular programming paradigm.


### 4. **Fail-over and Self-improvement Routines**

- If repeated attempts with Claude don’t yield satisfactory results, the assistant can:
    - Highlight persistent gaps and suggest alternative ways to frame the request.
    - Offer to try local model inference (for basic tasks), seek information from external sources, or initiate a human feedback loop.


### 5. **Generalized Multimodal Support**

- Beyond coding, this assistant paradigm can be extended to other tasks:
    - Automating file management, search, and retrieval.
    - Managing day-to-day workflows (meetings, notes, reminders) by applying similar request-response validation cycles.
    - Handling voice commands, images, and smart device actions with the same review/retry logic.


### 6. **Transparency and User-in-the-Loop Controls**

- Throughout each step, the assistant should keep you informed of:
    - What was checked versus your specs.
    - What is missing or ambiguous.
    - What is being retried or escalated.
- At any point, you can override, accept, or refine its judgment, maintaining ultimate authority over decisions and outputs.

**In summary:**
A "Jarvis"-style assistant not only serves as a conduit between you and Claude Pro, but also becomes a true co-pilot—formalizing your intent, reviewing Claude's work, performing iterative refinements, and extending these practices to all AI-assisted workflows. By adding layers of context-awareness, validation, and automation, the assistant can offer both higher productivity and greater reliability across many personal and professional tasks.

# Expanded Use Cases for Your “Jarvis”-Style Assistant

Your core workflow—automated validation of Claude Pro outputs with intelligent retry loops—is a powerful foundation. Beyond refining code generation, here **seven additional domains** where your assistant can add value by applying the same principles of structured prompting, validation, and iterative improvement:

## 1. Research \& Summarization

Your assistant can ingest lengthy articles, papers, or transcripts and:

- Generate structured summaries with key findings, methods, and conclusions.
- Validate completeness by checking for specified sections (e.g., “Methods,” “Results,” “Implications”).
- Retry or clarify with Claude until each section meets your quality rubric.


## 2. Project Planning \& Task Management

- Translate high-level goals into detailed task breakdowns, timelines, and dependencies.
- Cross-check against your preferred templates (e.g., Agile sprint boards, Gantt charts).
- If an item is missing (e.g., risk assessment), auto-prompt Claude with “Add missing risk section.”


## 3. Documentation \& Style Enforcement

- Convert design decisions or code comments into polished README files, API docs, or wikis.
- Enforce your organization’s style guide by validating headings, code snippet formatting, and link correctness.
- Automatically adjust and re-request until all style violations are resolved.


## 4. Data Analysis \& Reporting

- Produce data-driven narratives: given CSV or JSON inputs, draft insights, charts, and summary tables.
- Validate that all requested metrics (e.g., mean, median, growth rates) are present.
- If a metric is omitted, trigger Claude to compute and include it.


## 5. Communication \& Correspondence

- Draft emails, proposals, or presentations tailored to stakeholder profiles.
- Validate tone, length, and call-to-action presence against your specifications.
- Retry with alternate phrasings until the style matches your preferences (e.g., formal vs. conversational).


## 6. Learning \& Tutoring

- Pose quiz questions or flashcards on specified topics, then check for coverage across chapters or concepts.
- If a concept is underrepresented, generate additional practice items.
- Provide step-by-step solutions and verify each step’s clarity and correctness.


## 7. DevOps \& Automation Scripts

- Given an environment description, draft shell scripts, Dockerfiles, or CI/CD pipelines.
- Validate syntax, best practices (e.g., security flags), and completeness (e.g., test steps included).
- Auto-retry to fill gaps such as missing cleanup commands or health checks.

**By extending your assistant into these areas, you leverage the same architecture of**:

1. **Structured instruction parsing**
2. **Automated output validation** against custom rubrics
3. **Iterative refinement** via Claude Pro

This transforms “Jarvis” into a versatile co-pilot across development, research, operations, and communication tasks—ensuring consistent quality and reducing manual reviews.

# Additional Use Cases for Your “Jarvis”-Style Assistant

Beyond mediating with Claude Pro and validating code outputs, your assistant can leverage its agentic architecture, local file‐processing capability, and AI tools to support binary file analysis and advanced academic writing tasks:

## 1. Local Binary File Processing

Equip the assistant with direct file‐I/O abilities so it can:

- **Inspect and parse arbitrary binary formats** (images, executables, serialized data).
- **Convert binary to human‐readable representations**, such as hex dumps or decoded text sections.
- **Automate repetitive data‐extraction workflows**, for example extracting embedded metadata or converting proprietary file formats to open standards.
- **Validate file integrity** by computing checksums or detecting corrupt segments.
This can be achieved by integrating a sandboxed Python runtime (e.g., Code Interpreter) that reads files in binary mode and runs user‐defined parsing scripts[^5_1].


## 2. Research Paper Review and Grammar Correction

Integrate specialized NLP pipelines and grammar‐checking models so the assistant can:

- **Detect linguistic and stylistic errors** across sections of a manuscript—abstract, introduction, methodology, etc.—and mark them in situ.
- **Suggest domain‐appropriate vocabulary enhancements** and rewrite awkward sentences for clarity.
- **Validate adherence to journal style guides** (e.g., APA or IEEE), ensuring citations, headings, and formatting conform to requirements.
- **Generate summary reports** of all identified issues with links to corrected passages.
By calling out to grammar‐checking APIs or embedding local transformer models fine‐tuned on academic text, the assistant can provide line‐by‐line annotations and batch corrections[^5_2][^5_3].


## 3. Thesis Formatting and Structure Enforcement

Extend the assistant’s capabilities to fully support dissertation workflows:

- **Apply LaTeX or Word templates** automatically, populating front matter (title page, acknowledgements, TOC) based on user metadata.
- **Validate structural elements** (chapter ordering, figure/table numbering, cross‐references) against university guidelines.
- **Automate bibliography generation and formatting** by parsing reference metadata (DOIs, BibTeX entries) and enforcing consistent formatting (APA, MLA, Chicago).
- **Perform plagiarism checks and citation completeness** by cross‐referencing against academic databases.
Tools like Paperpal and Yomu AI demonstrate how AI can organize, structure, and refine large academic documents, ensuring compliance and coherence[^5_4].

By incorporating these use cases within your multi‐agent framework—combining on‐device processing for speed and privacy with cloud calls for heavy‐duty tasks—you create a truly versatile “Jarvis” that handles raw binaries, polishes scholarly writing, and enforces complex formatting rules with minimal manual intervention.

# Implementation Plan

## A. Hardware \& Resource Constraints

- **RAM:** 8 GB unified memory.
- **Storage:** 10 GB allocated (expandable if needed).
- **Compute:** Apple M2 Neural Engine + 8-core GPU via Metal.


## B. Model Selection \& Hosting Strategy

| Role | Model | Quantization | Size (GGUF) | Fits RAM? | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Local “Brain”** | Phi-3-Mini-4K-Instruct | Q4_K_M | 2.2 GB | Yes | Primary offline assistant |
|  | Gemma-2B-Instruct | Q4_K_M | 1.5 GB | Yes | Fast lookups \& low-latency tasks |
| **Extended Reasoning** | Mistral-7B-Instruct | Q4_K_M | 4.4 GB | Partial | Off-load upper layers to CPU if needed |
|  | Llama-3-8B | Q4_K_M | 4.7 GB | Partial | Needs RAM off-load; fallback for heavy Qs |
| **Cloud Fallback** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | N/A | N/A | N/A | High-quality code \& draft generation |

- **Primary**: Keep Phi-3-Mini and Gemma-2B loaded in RAM.
- **Secondary**: Load Mistral-7B or Llama-3-8B only when needed, using llama.cpp’s `n_gpu_layers`/Metal off-load to CPU.
- **Fallback**: Delegate to Claude Pro via API for tasks exceeding local capacity or quality.


## C. Software Stack

1. **Model Serving**
    - Install `llama.cpp` or `ollama` (Metal GPU enabled).
    - Host local models as OpenAI-compatible server endpoints.
2. **Multi-Agent Framework**
    - Use LangChain or LangGraph to define agents:
        - **Resident Agent**: Routes simple queries to local LLMs.
        - **Proxy Agent**: Formats prompts/checks outputs, calls Claude if needed.
3. **Tool Integration**
    - Register macOS tools (shell, file I/O, browser automation) as JSON-schema tools via LangChain’s ReAct agent.
    - Expose Python sandbox for binary file parsing and data-analysis pipelines.
4. **Memory \& Persistence**
    - Short-term: ConversationBufferMemory in RAM.
    - Long-term: Embeddings stored in lightweight SQLite/Chroma on disk.

## D. Deployment Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
    - `brew install ggml-org/llama.cpp/llama.cpp` (Metal support)
    - `pip install langchain llama-cpp-python ollama langgraph chromadb`
2. **Download \& Quantize Models**

```bash
hughf-cli repo download microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf --include "*Q4_K_M.gguf"
hughf-cli repo download google/gemma-2b-GGUF --include "*Q4_K_M.gguf"
hughf-cli repo download TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF --include "*Q4_K_M.gguf"
```

3. **Serve Local Models**

```bash
ollama serve
export OLLAMA_HOST="http://localhost:11434"
```

4. **Agent Graph Definition**
    - Resident node: loads Phi-3 and Gemma.
    - Proxy node: uses Claude client with retry logic (check vs. rubric).
5. **Validation \& Retry Logic**
    - Implement a validation layer that:

6. Parses expected output schema.
7. Compares with AI response.
8. Generates targeted Claude sub-prompts for missing elements.
1. **File \& Data Workflows**
    - Python sandbox tool: read binary files, parse with `struct` or domain-specific libraries.
    - Data analysis: load CSV/JSON via Python tool, auto-generate JSON summaries for the agent.
2. **Academic Writing Pipeline**
    - Integrate grammar-checking library (e.g., `language_tool_python`) in sandbox.
    - Style enforcement: define formatting rules and automate LaTeX template population.

## E. Testing \& Optimization

1. **Benchmark Token Throughput** on M2 Air: target ≥10 tokens/sec with Phi-3.
2. **Memory Profiling**: adjust `n_gpu_layers` to balance GPU vs. CPU.
3. **Claude Quota Monitoring**: track monthly token usage (<50 k tokens for ~\$0.75).

By combining lightweight local models for day-to-day tasks with a cloud-based Claude fallback, structured validation loops, and file/data processing tools, this plan delivers a modular, resource-efficient “Jarvis” on your MacBook Air M2 within your 8 GB RAM and 10 GB storage constraints.

# Maximizing Your AI Subscriptions: Leveraging Gemini, Claude Pro, and Perplexity Pro

**Top Recommendation:** Use each platform’s **native, no-API features** in concert—ini Pro for deep multimodal research and Google-Workspace integration; Claude Pro for high-quality code generation; and Perplexity Pro for real-time sourced answers and advanced file analysis—rather than juggling APIs.

## 1. Google Gemini Pro: Multimodal “AI Hub”

Gemini Pro (via Google One’s AI Pro tier) extends beyond text chat to handle images, audio, video, and large documents, with built-in integrations into Google Workspace. Key no-API benefits include:

- **Deep Research \& NotebookLM:** Upload files or Drive folders for 1 million-token summaries, cross-document comparisons, and audio overviews in NotebookLM[^7_1].
- **Flow \& Whisk Video Creation:** Text→video and image→video generation without separate API keys, ideal for quick storyboarding or social clips[^7_1].
- **Workspace Embedding:** Compose and refine content directly inside Gmail, Docs, Slides, and Sheets using Gemini 2.5 Pro “AI Mode,” with calendar, Drive, and Keep connectivity all in one interface[^7_2].

_Image: Gemini AI desktop interface showing file upload and Workspace integration_
Caption: Gemini Pro’s file-upload and Workspace-native assistant at work.

## 2. Claude Pro: Expert Code \& Advanced Reasoning

You already subscribe to Claude Pro for “Claude Code.” Maximize it by:

- **Conversation Modes:** Switch between “Sonnet Thinking” for deep technical reasoning and “Opus” for concise explanations—no extra configuration needed in the Claude app.
- **Large-Context Projects:** Leverage the 200 k-token context window in Claude 4.0 Sonnet for reviewing extensive codebases or research documents without API calls.
- **Custom Workflows:** Use built-in “retries” and “histories” features to automatically revisit unsatisfactory code outputs within the chat; annotate and track iterative improvements in the UI rather than via external scripts.


## 3. Perplexity Pro: Real-Time, Source-Backed Search \& File Analysis

Perplexity Pro complements the above with instant, cited knowledge and file-analysis tools:

- **Pro Search Modes:**
    - **Best Mode** auto-selects GPT-4.1, Claude 4.0 Sonnet, or Gemini 2.5 Pro under the hood for nuanced queries[^7_3].
    - **Reasoning Search** (R1/o3-Pro) tackles multi-step analytical questions with custom fine-tuned models[^7_3].
    - **Research Mode** autonomously orchestrates dozens of searches and citations for deep reports.
- **File Upload \& Analysis:** Instantly upload PDFs, spreadsheets, or code archives for extraction, summarization, and on-the-fly CSV table generation.
- **Labs:** For heavyweight tasks—dashboards, slide decks, simple web apps—invoke Labs to conduct multi-tool workflows end-to-end without manual orchestration[^7_3].
- **Perks \& Partnerships:** Access exclusive discounts on research journals, premium data sources, and developer tools via the Pro Perks program[^7_4].


## 4. Synergistic Workflow (No APIs Required)

1. **Research Kickoff (Perplexity Pro):** Start with Research Mode to gather data, citations, and initial outlines.
2. **Deep Dive \& Multimodal Enrichment (Gemini Pro):** Upload long reports or datasets into Gemini for structured analysis, add charts via NotebookLM.
3. **Code Generation \& Refinement (Claude Pro):** Copy refined prompts into Claude Code, use iterative “Sonnet Thinking” to achieve production-ready code.
4. **Final Polishing (Perplexity Labs):** Combine all assets in a Lab project—auto-generate slides, summaries, and lightweight apps for delivery.

## 5. Additional Benefits \& Tips

- **Zero-Config Integrations:** All three platforms integrate seamlessly into your browser and Google Workspace (Gemini), IDE/editor plugins (Claude), and web app (Perplexity).
- **Priority Performance:** As a Pro subscriber on all three, you enjoy accelerated response times and extended context windows without API rate limits.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Avoid API overages by using built-in interfaces for each service; allocate your usage to free local interactions where possible.

*By aligning each platform to its core strengths—Perplexity Pro’s sourced search, Gemini Pro’s multimodal intelligence, and Claude Pro’s expert coding—you can build a cohesive, high-throughput “Jarvis” workflow entirely within their native UIs.*

## Clarifying Your Multi-Modal Integration Vision

To design an optimal workflow that leverages Gemini, Claude Pro, and Perplexity Pro together, let’s narrow down your goals and constraints. Please the following:

1. **Primary Task Types:**
Which kinds of tasks are highest priority for this integrated “super-agent”?
    - Code generation \& validation
    - Research \& citation-backed summaries
    - Multimodal processing (images, audio, video)
    - Document analysis and grammar/style enforcement
    - Data analysis and charting
    - Other (please specify)
2. **Quality vs. Speed Trade-Off:**
For each task, how do you prioritize:
    - Absolute top-tier output quality (even if latency is higher), or
    - Near-real-time responses (trading off some depth)?
3. **Interaction Pattern:**
Do you envision:
    - A single unified interface that automatically routes your input to the “best” model, or
    - A stepwise pipeline where you choose—for example—“Research,” then “Refine Code,” then “Verify with Perplexity”?
4. **Data Privacy \& Local Processing:**
Are there any categories of data you need to keep entirely local (e.g., proprietary code, confidential documents)?
    - If so, specify which, and whether you’d accept locally hosted open-source models to process them.
5. **Context Window Requirements:**
What’s the typical length of the inputs you’ll provide?
    - Short prompts (<1,000 tokens)
    - Medium documents (1,000–20,000 tokens)
    - Large research papers or codebases (>20,000 tokens)
6. **Feedback \& Iteration Loop:**
How interactive should the system be in refining outputs?
    - Fully automated multi-round loops, or
    - Manual checkpoints where you inspect and then reroute?
7. **Output Aggregation:**
How do you want the final result delivered?
    - Single consolidated response with citations and code snippets, or
    - Segmented outputs per modality (e.g., one section from Gemini, one from Claude, one from Perplexity)?

Once you share these details, we can map out an architecture and workflow that dynamically routes your requests to Gemini, Claude Pro, and Perplexity Pro—ensuring you consistently get the best of each.

# Clarifying Your Integrated “Super-Agent” Vision

To design a unified interface that dynamically leverages Perplexity Pro’s Research Mode, Google Gemini’s NotebookLM, and Claude Pro under the—while prioritizing **research quality**, supporting **medium‐to‐large inputs**, ensuring **privacy** for confidential papers, and allowing **manual checkpoints** for code—it’s essential to nail down specific workflow requirements. Below are targeted questions to refine your needs and arrive at an optimal architecture:

1. **Unified Interface vs. Stepwise Pipeline**
    - Would you prefer a single chat‐style UI where you paste any prompt and the system routes tasks automatically, or a guided pipeline with explicit stages (e.g., “Start Research → Summarize → Code Validate → Final Review”)?
2. **Research Depth \& Citation Needs**
    - In Research Mode (Perplexity Pro), how many sources and what level of citation transparency do you require? Do you need exportable bibliographies or embedded footnotes?
3. **NotebookLM Integration Scope**
    - For Google Gemini’s NotebookLM, are you uploading multi‐document corpora exclusively for research papers, or also for internal docs (e.g., design specs)? Do you need mind maps, audio overviews, or solely text summaries?
4. **Confidentiality Triggers \& Local Processing**
    - Should “research paper” workflows automatically route to a local, on‐device LLM (Phi-3/Gemma) or a private NotebookLM Enterprise workspace? Where exactly must data remain local versus in the cloud?
5. **Context Window \& Chunking Strategy**
    - For large inputs (>20 k tokens), would you accept automatic document‐chunking with semantic retrieval (vector DB) before feeding into Perplexity or Claude, or do you need full‐document context preserved end-to-end?
6. **Validation \& Retry Policies**
    - Outside code (manual checkpoints), for research outputs do you want auto-validation checks (e.g., “Check that all headings appear”) and automatic retries, or only manual “flag and re-query” prompts?
7. **Output Aggregation \& Formatting**
    - How would you like results delivered? As a consolidated report that integrates:
        - a Perplexity‐generated research summary with citations,
        - a NotebookLM exploration section, and
        - optional Claude‐refined code snippets—
all in one document? Or as segmented outputs per service?
8. **Latency Thresholds for Research**
    - Given Research Mode can take up to 3–5 minutes for deep analysis[^9_1], what is your maximum acceptable turnaround for a single research request?
9. **User Controls \& Overrides**
    - How much control should you have at each stage? For example, “Skip further retries,” “Switch model,” or “Approve summary” before moving on.
10. **Long-Term Memory \& Knowledge Base**
    - Should the system store past research findings, custom glossaries, or your private notes in a vector store for future retrieval, and if so, which domain(s) require persistent memory?

Once these questions are answered, we can propose:

- A **router agent** (LangChain MultiRouteChain) that inspects incoming queries,
- A **task‐specific chain** for research (Perplexity Research Mode),
- A **document exploration chain** (NotebookLM API or Enterprise),
- A **code validation chain** (Claude Pro with manual checkpoints),
- And a **privacy wrapper** that enforces local processing for confidential papers.

Please let me know your preferences on the above points so we can architect the most effective multi-modal “Jarvis” for your workflow.

# Designing a Stepwise Pipeline for Your Multi-Modal “Jarvis” Assistant

Your vision: a unified “super-agent” that dynamically routes tasks to Perplexity Pro (research), Google’s NotebookLM (document exploration), and Claude Pro (code), while preserving confidentiality for sensitive files, supporting large inputs, automating validation, and maintaining long-term memory. Below is a deep dive into each aspect of the **stepwise pipeline** architecture, with concrete strategies and trade-offs.

## 1. Stepwise Pipeline vs. Unified Chat UI

- **Stepwise Pipeline**: A guided sequential workflow with distinct stages

1. **Ingestion \& Privacy Check**
2. **Preprocessing \& Chunking**
3. **Model-Specific Processing**
4. **Validation \& Retry**
5. **Aggregation \& Formatting**
6. **Memory \& Persistence**
- **Unified Chat UI**: One chat interface that inspects each query and dynamically routes sub-tasks to the appropriate service behind the scenes, offering maximum simplicity at the cost of less user visibility.

**Recommendation**: Start with a stepwise pipeline for clear observability and control, then evolve to a unified UI once flows stabilize.

## 2. Ingestion \& Confidentiality Triggers

- **Automatic Mode Detection**
    - If file flagged “confidential” (e.g., research paper), route to **local LLM** (Phi-3 Mini or Gemma-2B) for all processing steps to prevent data exfiltration[^10_1].
    - Otherwise, allow cloud services (Perplexity, Gemini, Claude) per task.
- **Local File I/O Sandbox**
    - Use a secured Python sandbox tool that reads files from a locked directory, ensuring no upload to third-party.


## 3. Preprocessing \& Chunking Strategy

- **Chunking Techniques**[^10_2]:
    - *Fixed-Size with Overlap*: 600–800 tokens per chunk, 10% overlap for context preservation.
    - *Semantic/Variable-Size*: Split on headings, paragraphs or topic shifts using NotebookLM’s section markers.
    - *Recursive Splitters*: For very large papers (>20 k tokens), recursively split and embed with local vector DB (e.g., Chroma).
- **Chunk Routing**
    - *Research (Perplexity)*: Send chunks with metadata + citation request.
    - *Exploration (NotebookLM)*: Upload entire document or selected chunks for mind maps \& cross-doc linking.
    - *Code (Claude)*: Send only relevant snippets and prompts, not entire papers.


## 4. Model-Specific Processing \& Depth

| Stage | Service | Quality vs. Speed | Context Window | Citation Support |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Research Summaries | Perplexity Pro Research Mode | Quality prioritized; latency unlimited | Full: >200 k tokens via chunked retrieval | Embedded citations and exportable bibliography[^10_3] |
| Document Exploration | Gemini NotebookLM | Medium latency, interactive | Up to 1 M tokens per Notebook | Section-level linking, mind maps, audio overviews |
| Code Generation \& Review | Claude Pro (Sonnet/Opus modes) | Manual checkpoint with retries | 200 k token context window | N/A (but code comments validated by rubric) |
| Confidential Content | Local LLMs (Phi-3, Gemma) | Fast, on-device; lower quality than cloud | 4 k–8 k tokens per model | No external citations, but internal references preserved |

## 5. Validation \& Automatic Retry Policies

- **Validation Layer**
    - Define a JSON-schema or checklist per task (e.g., “Methods,” “Results,” “References” for research; “function signatures,” “comments” for code).
    - After each model call, compare response against checklist; highlight missing items.
- **Auto-Retry Logic**
    - If any checks fail, generate targeted sub-prompts (e.g., “Add missing ‘Limitations’ section”) and re-invoke the same model.
    - Limit retries to a configurable maximum (e.g., 3 attempts) to prevent infinite loops.
- **Live Observability**
    - Expose a dashboard or CLI view showing each stage’s status, validations passed/failed, and active retries.


## 6. Output Aggregation \& Formatting

- **Consolidated Report**

1. **Header**: Task description, tools used, timestamps.
2. **Research Section** (Perplexity): Summary with in-text citations and bibliography.
3. **Exploration Section** (NotebookLM): Mind-map visuals, cross-doc links.
4. **Code Section** (Claude): Final code blocks annotated with validation logs.
5. **Audit Trail**: Validation results and retry logs.
- **Delivery Mechanisms**
    - **Local App/UI**: Electron or Tauri front-end that orchestrates API calls and local model invocations.
    - **Document Export**: Generate a single Markdown or PDF combining all sections.
    - **API Integration**: Optionally expose an internal HTTP endpoint that returns structured JSON for each stage, allowing custom front-ends.


## 7. Context Window \& Chunking Trade-Offs

- **Medium Inputs (1 k–20 k tokens)**: Single-pass chunking with 800-token windows; feed sequentially to each model stage.
- **Large Inputs (>20 k tokens)**:
    - *Vector-store + RAG*: Embed chunks into Chroma or FAISS, retrieve top-K relevant chunks per query.
    - *NotebookLM multi-doc workspace*: Upload entire document set and rely on built-in chunking.
- **Extended Time Impacts**
    - Recent research highlights that extremely long single-session prompts may lose coherence[?]. Mitigate by iterative chunk retrieval rather than one giant prompt.


## 8. User Controls \& Overrides

- **Interactive Prompts** at each stage:
    - “Approve summary?” → Yes/No → Retry or Next.
    - “Adjust chunk size?” → Manual override.
- **Model Selection Switch**: Toggle between local and cloud for any stage.
- **Abort or Skip**: Skip retries, or abort pipeline with partial outputs.


## 9. Long-Term Memory \& Knowledge Base

- **Vector Store** (Chroma/SQLite+pgvector) to persist:
    - Past research summaries and embeddings.
    - Approved code snippets and validation schemas.
    - User preferences and glossary terms.
- **Retrieval Chain**:
    - On new tasks, first retrieve relevant past interactions to prime model prompts.
    - Maintain metadata tags (e.g., “thesis,” “project-X”).
- **Privacy for Confidential Data**
    - Index only metadata pointers; keep full texts encrypted on local disk.


### Conclusion

This **stepwise pipeline**—from ingestion to long-term memory—ensures robust routing, confidentiality for sensitive files, automated quality control, and seamless aggregation of outputs from Perplexity Pro, Gemini NotebookLM, and Claude Pro. User-configurable controls and an explicit retry/validation mechanism guarantee both transparency and the highest output quality.

# Architecting a Concurrent, Credential-Driven “Jarvis” Across Gemini, Claude Pro, and Perplexity Pro

**Main Recommendation:**
Implement a **stepwise, fan-out orches layer** that holds your credentials for each service, replicates your input to all three LLMs in parallel, collects their outputs, then applies a lightweight validation and aggregation step. This delivers the “best of” each model while giving you full visibility and control over the process.

## 1. High-Level Orchestration Workflow

1. **Credential Store**
Securely hold your API keys (Claude Pro, Gemini Pro, Perplexity Pro) in an encrypted local vault.
2. **Unified Input Interface**
A single prompt UI (CLI, GUI, or notebook) where you paste your query.
3. **Concurrent Fan-Out**
Simultaneously invoke:
    - **Perplexity Pro** (Research Mode with embedded citations)
    - **Gemini Pro NotebookLM** (for document-level deep dives)
    - **Claude Pro** (Sonnet or Opus for code or reasoning)
4. **Validation \& Retry**
After each response, run lightweight checks (e.g., “Does research include ≥3 citations?”). If any output fails, automatically re-prompt that service up to N times while logging each iteration.
5. **Aggregation \& Formatting**
Merge the three outputs into one consolidated report:
    - Research summary with Perplexity citations
    - NotebookLM insights (mind-map, headings)
    - Claude-refined code snippets or reasoning
6. **User Review \& Overrides**
Present you with each section and the validation log; allow manual edits or additional retries before final export.

## 2. Key Components and Tools

| Component | Purpose | Example Framework/Tool |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Credential Management | Securely store and rotate API keys | Aembit, LiteLLM UI Credentials[^11_1] |
| Orchestration Engine | Dispatch, monitor, retry concurrent LLM calls | LangChain MultiRouteChain[^11_2] |
| Concurrency \& Fan-Out | Parallel prompt queue | Async Prompt Queue pattern[^11_3] |
| Validation Layer | Schema/rubric checks \& automated retries | JSON-schema checks + ReAct agent |
| Aggregation \& UI | Merge outputs, show logs, permit overrides | Tauri/Electron front-end |
| Persistence \& Memory | Store past interactions \& retrieval embeddings | Chroma + SQLite |

## 3. Concurrent Prompting Strategies

- **Parallel Queries with Shared Prefix**
Use a shared “meta-prompt” that encapsulates task instructions, then fan-out to each model with a service-specific wrapper:

```text
[META] Please produce:
1. A concise research summary with citations.
2. Key insights and mind-map structure.
3. Production-ready code snippet or algorithmic reasoning.

[INPUT] {your prompt}
```

- **Async Queue Management**
Adopt an asynchronous queue so each request to Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity is non-blocking. Monitor each through promise/future objects and collect results as they arrive[^11_3].
- **Credential Injection**
At dispatch time, the orchestrator loads the correct API key from the vault and attaches it to the request headers (no manual copy/paste) via a secure proxy layer (e.g., a small FastAPI or Koa microservice).


## 4. Validation \& Retry Logic

1. **Define Per-Task Checklists**
    - Research: ≥3 sources, sections (Method, Results) present
    - NotebookLM: clear headings \& links for each chapter
    - Code: compiles or passes linting rules
2. **Automate with JSON Schema**
Post-process each LLM’s JSON response against the schema.
3. **Retry Loop**
If validation fails, generate a targeted sub-prompt (e.g., “Add missing Results section with citations”) and resend—up to 3 attempts.
4. **Live Observability**
Display a dashboard of each model’s status, validation passes/fails, and retry counts.

## 5. Aggregation \& Final Output

- **Consolidated Markdown/PDF**
Combine all validated outputs into one document with:

1. Title \& meta (timestamps, tools used)
2. Research Summary (Perplexity)
3. NotebookLM Exploration (Gemini)
4. Code/Algorithm Section (Claude)
5. Audit Trail (validation logs \& retry history)
- **Segmented JSON**
Optionally expose a JSON structure with separate fields for each service, usable by custom front-ends or further pipelines.


## 6. User Controls \& Extensions

- **Manual Checkpoints**
Pause after each stage for your approval before proceeding.
- **Model Overrides**
Switch off a service: e.g., “Skip Gemini and re-route to Claude” for code-only tasks.
- **Long-Term Memory**
Log final approved outputs and embed them into a vector store (Chroma) for future retrieval and context priming.

By combining **parallel prompting**, **secure credential handling**, **automated validation**, and an **aggregated review interface**, your “Jarvis” can invoke Gemini, Claude Pro, and Perplexity Pro in unison—delivering the strongest output from each while preserving full transparency and control.

# Step-by-Step Guide: Building a Parallel Multi-Agent “Jarvis” with Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity

Here’s a structured plan for implementing your “Jarvis” assistant that sends your input to Claude Pro, Gemini Pro, and Perplexity Pro simultaneously, gathers their outputs, runs validations, and presents everything in a single interface.

## 1. **Set Up a Secure Credential Store**

- Create a secure, encrypted vault on your Mac to store your Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity credentials.
- Use tools like your OS’s Keychain or encrypted file-based secrets manager to avoid handling plain-text API keys.
- This ensures that your assistant accesses each service securely without exposing sensitive information.


## 2. **Unified Input Interface**

- Start with a simple desktop application or command-line interface where you enter or paste your query.
- This interface will:
    - Accept plain text, file drops (for research papers or datasets), or structured prompts.
    - Allow you to specify if a file is “confidential” (to enforce local-only processing).


## 3. **Concurrent “Fan-Out” Orchestration**

- When you issue a command, the assistant simultaneously sends:
    - **Your research or analysis request to Perplexity Pro** (using its research/file mode).
    - **The same request to Gemini Pro** (especially when document exploration via NotebookLM is needed).
    - **Your instruction to Claude Pro**, especially for code, deep reasoning, or synthesis tasks.
- Each call uses its dedicated credential from the vault.


## 4. **Validation and Automated Retry**

- For each model’s response:
    - Run an automated validation check (e.g., Does Perplexity’s answer cite sources? Did Gemini produce all required sections? Does Claude’s code follow the expected format?).
    - If any output misses key requirements, the system auto-reprompts that specific model with a targeted clarifying question. Retry up to a set limit (e.g., 3 times).
    - Log each validation step and retry for transparency.


## 5. **Aggregation and Presentation**

- Once all outputs are in:
    - The assistant merges responses into a consolidated markdown or PDF report.
    - Each service’s output is clearly labeled (e.g., “Perplexity Pro Result,” “Gemini NotebookLM Exploration,” “Claude Pro Code/Analysis”).
    - Include a validation log showing what checks passed/failed.
- The interface allows you to:
    - Approve each section, request further retries, or manually edit before finalizing.


## 6. **User Review and Overrides**

- Maintain manual checkpoints after presenting the results.
- Provide options such as:
    - Retry or rephrase the prompt to any service.
    - Skip a section or exclude from the final report.
    - Export the report in markdown, PDF, or JSON formats.


## 7. **Long-Term Memory and Retrieval**

- Store each completed report, along with your manual edits and validation logs, in a local vector database (e.g., Chroma or SQLite + embeddings).
- This enables quick retrieval of past results and auto-suggestion of relevant prior work for new queries, while keeping confidential data on your device.


## 8. **Extending the System**

- As your needs grow, you can add:
    - Local LLMs for fully private tasks (especially when handling research papers flagged as “confidential”).
    - Additional output types (charts, mind maps) from Gemini or Perplexity.
    - More advanced validation layers specific to each domain (grammar checking for academic writing, code test harness for programming).


## **Summary Table: Flow Overview**

| Step | Function | User Control Points |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Credential Management | Secure API key storage | Initial setup |
| Unified Input | Enter prompts and upload files | Mark confidential files |
| Parallel Model Invocation | Send tasks to all services at once | Toggle which models to use |
| Output Validation | Check results, auto-retry if needed | Set retry limits |
| Aggregation \& Review | Merge, label, and present results | Approve/edit/retry |
| Long-Term Memory | Store and retrieve previous work locally | Search prior results |

## **Closing Advice**

This structure gives you maximum quality, transparency, and control over all outputs from your LLM subscriptions, with privacy for sensitive work and parallel “best of all worlds” intelligence. As your workflow matures, you can tailor the orchestration and validation rules to better fit your research, coding, and creative processes.

# Moving Forward: Building Your Multi-Agent Parallel “Jarvis”

You’ve finalized your requirements and workflow vision—now it’s time to start building. Below is a practical, step-by-step path for setting up your “Jarvis” that concurrently leverages Claude Pro, Gemini Pro, and Perplexity Pro.

## 1. Environment and Prerequisites

- **Platform:** MacBook Air M2 with 8GB RAM and at least 10GB free storage.
- **Accounts Needed:** Active subscriptions to Claude Pro, Google Gemini Pro, and Perplexity Pro.
- **Credentials:** Gather your login/API tokens (if available), or prepare for browser/API automation where direct API use isn’t available.


## 2. Credential Security

- **Store Secrets Securely:**
    - Use Apple Keychain or an encrypted credentials manager.
    - Never hard-code sensitive credentials in your scripts.


## 3. Core Components Overview

| Component | Role |
| :-- | :-- |
| Unified Input UI | Accepts text, research papers, datasets, etc. |
| Orchestration Core | Dispatches input to each AI provider in parallel and monitors completions |
| Validation Engine | Checks returned output against custom checklists/rubrics |
| Aggregation Module | Merges and structures the outputs for user review |
| User Review Layer | Allows “Approve,” “Retry,” or “Edit” for each output |
| Memory Store | Saves final results and validation logs for future recall |

## 4. Implementation Steps

### A. Develop a Unified Input Interface

- Start with a simple desktop GUI (e.g. Tkinter, Electron, or Tauri), web page, or CLI app.
- Must allow text input, file uploads, and “confidential” flag for files.


### B. Parallel Fan-Out Orchestration

- When a query is submitted, the orchestrator:
    - Sends prompts to Claude Pro, Gemini Pro (NotebookLM as needed), and Perplexity Pro at the same time.
    - Handles authentication for each using the appropriate credential.
    - Optionally: uses browser automation or HTTP requests if direct API not available.


### C. Validation and Automated Retry Logic

- For each output:
    - Apply task-specific checklists (e.g., research summary must have citations; code must have expected structure).
    - Auto-reprompt until requirements are met or retry limit reached.
    - Log all attempts for transparency.


### D. Aggregation, Presentation, and User Controls

- Collect validated outputs from all services.
- Present results in a clear report:
    - Service-labeled sections (e.g., “Perplexity Pro”, “Gemini”, “Claude”).
    - Validation status, errors, and retry history.
- Enable manual approval, further retries, exclusion, or editing before final export.


### E. Long-Term Memory and Knowledge Base

- Save each report along with logs and metadata in a local database (Chroma, SQLite, etc).
- Enable fast retrieval and search for future prompts, context priming, or knowledge base Q\&A.


## 5. Extending the System

- Add a local LLM (Phi-3 Mini, Gemma-2B) for confidential documents or full offline mode.
- Integrate more validation and QA modules (e.g., grammar checking, code syntax checks).
- Enhance output formats (Markdown, PDF export, mind-maps from Gemini/NotebookLM, tables and charts).


## 6. Testing and Best Practices

- Regularly monitor memory and storage usage, especially with larger models or datasets.
- Periodically rotate and update your credentials for security.
- Benchmark task timing to ensure parallel execution remains efficient.

**You’re ready to begin development.** This plan prioritizes clear separation of each workflow stage, respects confidentiality, runs validations with automated retries, and gives you ongoing flexibility to grow and adapt your Jarvis as your needs evolve. If you need sample starter code, setup scripts, or UI concepts, just specify which step you’d like to dive into first.

# Project Rename: Jarvis → **Samay**

Your assistant is now named **Samay**, drawing on the Jain concept of “time” and “right conduct”—setting the tone for a mindful, precise, and context-aware AI co-pilot.

## Project Scope and User Requirements

- **Storage available:** 95GB—ample for binaries, logs, local LLM models, temp files, and future expansion.
- **Integration method:** Native login (browser-based OAuth/web login) for Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity—not API keys or tokens.
- **Approach:**

1. Start with the basic UI and test login/integration of all accounts.
2. Prepare local LLM setup in parallel (Gemma, Phi-3, etc.).
3. Only proceed with advanced features once base authentication and connections work reliably.


## Required Applications \& Setup

You already own:

- VSCode (IDE, preferred)
- Anaconda (Python environment management)
- Android Studio (mobile, not needed right now)
- Xcode (for native Mac apps, optional for desktop GUI)

**Recommended additional installs:**


| Application | Purpose | Source | Required/Optional |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Node.js + npm | Desktop/UI (Electron, Tauri) | nodejs.org | Required |
| Python 3.10+ | Backend scripting, local LLMs | Anaconda/pyenv | Required |
| Git | Version control | Homebrew/Git | Required |
| Homebrew | Easy package management | brew.sh | Optional |
| Chrome/Edge | Browser automation | Google/Microsoft | Required |

## Step 1: File Storage Strategy

With 95GB, you can safely designate structured directories in your home folder or a dedicated “Samay” workspace.

Example structure:

```
~/Samay/
├── models/          # Local LLM binaries (5–20GB)
├── logs/            # App logs, debugging output
├── user_data/       # Downloaded/processed files
├── config/          # Login/session/config cache
├── workspace/       # Temporary docs for processing
├── memory/          # Knowledge base (Chroma/SQLite)
```

- Create these directories manually or through app initialization.
- **NEVER** store user passwords—only session cookies, encrypted credentials or “remember me” tokens (browser-native).


## Step 2: Development Environment Setup

**1. Python Environment (via Anaconda or pyenv)**

- Create a new environment:
`conda create -n samay python=3.10`
- Activate environment:
`conda activate samay`
- Essential packages (in env):
`pip install flask eel playwright chromadb`

**2. Node.js \& npm for Desktop UI**

- Install Node.js:
`brew install node` or download from nodejs.org
- If you choose:
    - **Electron** (for rapid cross-platform desktop):
`npm install --global electron`
    - **Tauri** (Rust-based, less resource-heavy):
`cargo install tauri-cli` (Rust toolchain needed, can be installed via Homebrew or rustup)
- UI frameworks: React (`npx create-react-app`), Svelte, or plain HTML/JS.

**3. Install Playwright or Selenium (Browser Automation)**

- Playwright (reliable for automation):

```
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

- This enables browser-based login workflows, NOT API keys.

**4. Local LLM/Model Tools**

- Prepare (for later steps):
    - `brew install ollama llama.cpp`
    - Download model files into `models/` as needed.


## Step 3: Building the Core UI \& Account Integrations

**A. UI Skeleton**

- Use Electron/Tauri/Flask-Eel to create a desktop window.
- Display three login cards/buttons: Claude, Gemini, Perplexity.
- Each button triggers an “Open Browser/Login” flow using Playwright scripts or opens a browser window directly.
- Store browser session cookies/tokens in your `config/` folder.

**B. Login Testing Steps**

1. Launch UI → Click a service login → Launches controlled browser instance.
2. User completes login → App monitors for successful session (e.g., looks for user dashboard page).
3. On success, store session token/cookie for future authenticated access (sessions, not raw passwords).

**C. Manual Test**

- After all three accounts are connected, basic queries can be dispatched by simulating user actions (copy-paste prompt, submit, fetch response).


## Step 4: Validate and Troubleshoot

- Confirm each service can be logged into and queried from the basic UI.
- Handle login failures, timeouts, or required multi-factor auth with clear error messages and a “retry” button.


## Step 5: Prepare for Local LLM Integration (In Parallel)

- Allocate `models/` directory for future model downloads.
- Plan out inference tool selection (Ollama or llama.cpp).
- No model setup is needed until logins work.


## Summary Table: Required Tools Setup

| Tool/Software | Install Command/Source | Purpose |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| VSCode | Already installed | Coding, debugging |
| Python/Anaconda | Already installed | Backend \& scripts |
| Node.js/nvm | `brew install node` | Electron/Tauri UI |
| Electron | `npm install -g electron` | Desktop shell |
| Playwright | `pip install playwright` | Browser automation/login |
| Ollama/llama.cpp | `brew install ollama llama.cpp` | Local LLM hosting (future) |
| Chrome/Edge | Download from provider | Automated browser needed |
| Git | `brew install git` | Version control |

## Next Steps

- Begin by initializing your file structure and environment.
- Build the minimal UI (“Samay” login testbed) with three login flows.
- Test end-to-end login for all three services.
- Once all accounts authenticate and basic queries succeed, proceed to fully integrate local LLM capabilities and workflow orchestration.

At each stage, ensure no sensitive data (like passwords) are ever stored unencrypted—prefer standardized web session secure storage and regular session renewal for account safety.

## Next Actions After Installing Node.js

You’ve completed installing Node.js, which is an essential foundation. Here’s what to do next from Step 2, based on your project requirements:

### 1. Choose a UI Framework/Toolkit

For your basic UI, choose **one** of these (both use Node.js):

- **Electron**: Fastest route to a cross-platform desktop app.
    - Install globally:

```
npm install --global electron
```

- **Tauri**: Lightweight; uses Rust (needs Rust toolchain installed).
    - Install via Cargo (if you plan to use Tauri):

```
cargo install tauri-cli
```

    - Requires Rust, which can be installed with:

```
brew install rust
```


If you’re new to desktop UIs, Electron is more beginner-friendly and aligns best with typical JavaScript/Node.js workflows.

### 2. (Optional) UI Framework Library

- For modern interfaces, consider installing a component library (React, Svelte, or plain HTML/CSS).
    - Create React App:

```
npx create-react-app samay-ui
```

    - Or scaffold manually with HTML/CSS, since for initial login testing, a simple layout is sufficient.


### 3. Install Playwright for Browser Automation

To handle login via browser method (not APIs), you’ll need Playwright:

```
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

- This Python tool allows for robust, automated login/session flows across browsers.
- Requires Python environment active (Anaconda or regular Python).


### 4. Set Up Python Environment

Ensure your Python backend environment is ready:

- If not already done, create a new Anaconda environment:

```
conda create -n samay python=3.10
conda activate samay
```

- Install needed packages:

```
pip install flask eel playwright chromadb
```


### 5. (Optional) Tauri and Rust for Lightweight GUI

Skip this if you stick with Electron for initial testing. Only follow Tauri steps if you specifically want a smaller resource footprint.

### What to Do Next

- If you’ve already installed Node.js and are aiming to start the integration/UI part, proceed to install Electron (or Tauri if you want).
- In parallel, set up your Python environment and Playwright.
- Once these are in place, you’ll be able to build the UI, implement login flows, and test connections to Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity via browser-controlled sessions.

**You do not need to install Android Studio or Xcode for the initial desktop app; VSCode, Node.js, Python, Electron/Playwright are sufficient.**

If you have questions or need step-by-step commands for any installation, let me know your choice of UI shell (Electron or Tauri), and I’ll tailor instructions for your workflow.

# Testing Logins in Your Samay App Using Playwright and React

Now that your environment is set up with Node.js, Playwright, and a React app scaffold (`samay-ui`), you can proceed to test login flows for each service (Claude, Gemini, Perplexity) through browser automation. Here’s a clear, actionable workflow:

## 1. Write a Playwright Login Test

First, create a test file in your project:

- Inside your React app folder (`samay-ui`), create a new directory, e.g. `tests`.
- Inside `tests`, add a file called `login.test.ts` (or `.js` if you prefer).

Paste the following template into this file:

```javascript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('login test for Samay services', async ({ page }) => {
  // 1. Go to the service's login page (e.g., Claude, Gemini, Perplexity)
  await page.goto('https://example.com/login'); // Replace with the actual service URL

  // 2. Enter username/email
  await page.fill('input[name="username"]', 'your_username'); // Adjust selector as needed

  // 3. Enter password
  await page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'your_password'); // Adjust selector as needed

  // 4. Click the login button
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]'); // Adjust selector as per the UI

  // 5. Check for a successful login indication (like welcome message or user avatar)
  await expect(page.locator('text="Welcome"')).toBeVisible(); // Modify as appropriate
});
```

**Note:**

- Update the URL to match the login page for Claude, Gemini, or Perplexity.
- Update selectors if the login form uses different names or HTML structure.
- Use environment variables or a secure method for credentials—do not hard-code them.


## 2. Run and Debug the Test

- Open a terminal in your project directory.
- Run the test using Playwright’s built-in test runner, enabling debug mode for interactivity:

```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

- The browser will launch, perform the login steps, and visibly show you the flow.
- If the login is successful, you’ll see the expected text or indicator for a logged-in user.


## 3. Adjust for Each Service

- Repeat the above process for each of your services:
    - Claude: Use its official login page and credentials.
    - Gemini: Use Google login (additional selector tweaks may be needed).
    - Perplexity: Use its own login page and expected UI signals.
- For each, make sure to update selectors and validation steps as needed.


## 4. Review and Troubleshoot

- If your test fails (e.g., element not found, wrong selectors, or redirect issues), review the error log and update selectors.
- Adjust the selectors and validation logic to fit each service’s UI.
- Playwright supports screenshots and error logging to help troubleshoot issues.


## 5. Security and Best Practices

- Always use environment variables for storing credentials, not raw plaintext in your code.
- Keep session/cookie files out of your repository (add to `.gitignore`).


## 6. Next Steps

- Once individual logins are tested, you can persist authentication state (cookies/session) for subsequent automated workflows.
- Expand your test to save the browser session (“storageState”) and reuse for device session persistence[^16_1][^16_2].
- Continue to build your “Samay” front-end, integrating these authenticated flows as you enhance your UI.

By following these steps, you ensure your browser automation setup is working and have a clear infrastructure for scaling up the Samay assistant login/integration[^16_1][^16_2][^16_3].

# Dealing with Modern Login Flows in Automated Testing

Modern authentication methods—such as Google OAuth login and email+OTP (One-Time Password)—present unique challenges compared to classic username/password flows when automating login tests for services like Claude, Gemini, or Perplexity. Here’s how to approach these cases:

## 1. Understanding Modern Auth Methods

- **OAuth (Google, Microsoft Login):**
    - No password is directly entered in the tested service.
    - The flow involves redirecting to Google’s login page, entering credentials, perhaps approving permissions, and redirecting back.
- **Email and OTP:**
    - After entering your email address, an OTP is sent to your inbox.
    - You must enter this OTP on the site to complete login.
- **Magic Link:**
    - Sometimes, instead of OTP, a link is sent to your inbox, which you must click to finish authentication.


## 2. Automating Google OAuth Login

- Your test must detect the “Sign in with Google” button, trigger it, then interact with the Google login pop-up.
- You’ll need to:
    - Enter your Google email and password in the pop-up.
    - Handle multi-factor authentication (MFA) if enabled (this can be a major automation blocker).
    - Approve any permissions prompt.
    - Wait for the redirect back to the main service—at this point, session cookies/tokens will be set.

**Tips:**

- Some automation frameworks allow you to save a “logged in” browser state and re-use it, so you only need to perform the OAuth process once manually, then load the session for future tests.
- Automating Google login may require additional Playwright settings to handle pop-ups and redirects.


## 3. Automating Email+OTP Flows

- Your script must:
    - Fill in your email and submit.
    - Wait for the OTP input form.
    - Retrieve the OTP from your mailbox (this typically requires integrating with a mail API, a temporary email service, or a way to parse local email files).
    - Enter the OTP and complete the login test.

**Tips:**

- For true end-to-end automation, using a test email account with API access makes this possible.
- For semi-manual testing, you can have your script pause, let you manually enter the OTP, and then continue.


## 4. Automating Magic Link Logins

- After submitting your email, the script must either:
    - Access the email, extract the magic link, and open it in the browser.
    - Or pause, let you manually click the link in your email, and then resume from the logged-in state.


## 5. Claude Login: Handling Both Methods

Since you mentioned you use both Google OAuth and email+OTP with Claude:

- You should write two test flows:
    - One following the OAuth path by clicking “Sign in with Google,” handling Google login.
    - Another that waits for the OTP, then allows either automated or manual input for the code.
- Consider saving the browser session (“storage state”) after a successful login, so you don’t repeat the login every time.


## 6. Practical Advice

- Full automation of OAuth and OTP logins can be fragile and tricky, especially with frequent UI updates and new security features.
- For ongoing development, it’s common to automate up to the login page, then do the login manually and save the session for automation and test continuity.
- Always be careful with storing and handling credentials—never hard-code passwords or OTP access in repositories.

By accommodating these newer authentication flows in your testing scripts, you’ll ensure your Samay assistant can log in and interact with modern web services securely and reliably, both in development and in future production workflows.

# Troubleshooting Your Playwright Test Issues

You’ve encountered several errors when attempting to run Playwright tests in your React-based project. Here’s a breakdown of what’s happening, why, and how to resolve these issues:

## 1. SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<' in App.js

**Cause:**
You attempted to run Playwright tests, but Node.js tried to execute or parse your React source files (like `App.js`), which contain JSX and import statements for images/styles. Node.js can’t handle these out-of-the-box.

**Why this happened:**

- Playwright test runners should *not* run your app component files or your pure React `.js`/`.jsx` source files directly.
- Playwright expects dedicated test files (e.g., `.spec.js`, `.test.js`), not your React components[^18_1][^18_2].

**Resolution:**

- Make sure your tests are placed in a separate `tests/` directory (or wherever Playwright looks for tests).
- Only files that are actual Playwright test scripts should be in your test directory.
- Do **not** reference `App.js`, `.svg`, or `.css` files directly in test scripts unless you are running component tests with correct setup.


## 2. Error: Cannot find module '@playwright/test'

**Cause:**
Your project is missing the Playwright test runner as a development dependency.

**How to fix:**

1. Navigate to your project root (where `package.json` is).
2. Install the Playwright test library:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
```

or, using yarn:

```bash
yarn add --dev @playwright/test
```

3. After installation, ensure that `@playwright/test` is listed in your `devDependencies`.

## 3. Error: No tests found

**Cause:**
Playwright did not discover any valid test files.
This is usually due to one of:

- Incorrect test file naming (test files must end with `.spec.js`, `.test.js`, `.spec.ts`, or `.test.ts` by default)
- Test files are in the wrong directory
- No valid test functions are exported in your test files[^18_3].

**How to fix:**

- Ensure your test scripts are named e.g. `login.test.ts`, `app.spec.js`, and are placed in a `tests/` or `e2e/` directory.
- Confirm your test files actually have valid Playwright test cases:

```javascript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('basic test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Example/);
});
```

- If you’re not using default directories or naming, set the correct test directory in your `playwright.config.ts` file[^18_4].


## 4. Best Practices for Playwright + React Projects

### Correct Folder Structure

```
your-project/
│
├── node_modules/
├── src/                 # React app source code (never run directly as tests)
│    ├── App.js
│    └── ...
├── tests/               # Place your Playwright .test.js/.spec.js files here
│    └── login.test.ts
├── package.json
├── playwright.config.ts # (autogenerated or create this)
```


### Sample Playwright Test (`tests/login.test.ts`)

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('login page works', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://service-url.com/login');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Login/);
});
```


### Install and Initialize Playwright

1. Install Playwright dependencies if not done yet:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

2. Use `npx playwright test` to run all test files in `tests/`.

## References

- Playwright documentation and best practices for folder structure and test setup[^18_5][^18_6][^18_2][^18_4][^18_3][^18_7].


### Next Steps

- Move/remove any `.js` files in `tests/` that aren’t actual Playwright test scripts.
- Install `@playwright/test` as above.
- Verify your test naming and locations.
- After these fixes, run:

```
npx playwright test --debug
```

Your tests should now be recognized and executed properly, and you’ll be able to proceed with UI automation and login checks.

If you hit any specific login automation challenges (Google OAuth, OTP), you can focus your next troubleshooting on just that area.

(samay) akshitharsola@Akshits-MacBook-Air samay-ui %

The error you’re encountering:

```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'
at src/App.js:1
```

typically happens because the test runner (Playwright here) is trying to parse your React source code files (like `App.js`) as if they were plain JavaScript or test scripts, but your React files include JSX and import statements that Node.js doesn’t understand natively.

### Why is this happening?

- Your Playwright test runner is picking up your React app source files (`src/App.js`) or the default React test files (`App.test.js`) as tests.
- Those React files contain JSX syntax (`<` tags) and imports like `import logo from './logo.svg'` which cause syntax errors when run directly in Node.
- Playwright expects dedicated test files written in JS/TS for browser automation (usually inside a separate test folder).


### How to fix this?

1. **Separate your test files from React source code**
    - Make sure your Playwright test scripts live in a separate folder, for example:

```
samay-ui/
  ├── src/               # React app files (App.js, App.css, etc.)
  ├── tests/             # Playwright test scripts here
  │    └── login.test.ts
```

    - Keep your React source files (`App.js`, `App.test.js`) only for app code and React unit tests, not for Playwright tests.
2. **Remove or ignore React test files during Playwright test runs**
    - For Playwright tests, rename or move `src/App.test.js` somewhere else or remove it temporarily.
    - Or configure Playwright to only look for tests inside the `tests/` folder, **not** inside `src/`.
3. **Install Playwright test package properly**

Make sure you installed Playwright’s test runner, which provides the `import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'` syntax.

Run in your project root:

```
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

4. **Create a dedicated Playwright config**

Add a `playwright.config.ts` or `playwright.config.js` at the root with at least:

```js
module.exports = {
  testDir: './tests',        // Tell Playwright to only look here for test files
  timeout: 30000,
};
```

5. **Run Playwright tests from the correct folder**

From your project root, run:

```
npx playwright test --debug
```

This will only run Playwright tests under the `tests/` folder and ignore React sources.

### Summary:

- Your error is because Playwright tries to parse `src/App.js` (which contains JSX) as a test script.
- Isolate Playwright tests from React app source by putting Playwright tests into a separate directory (`tests/`) and set Playwright’s `testDir` to point to it.
- Remove or exclude `src/App.test.js` if you don’t intend to run it with Playwright.
- Ensure you have installed `@playwright/test` and run tests only from the appropriate directory.


### Example steps:

```bash
mkdir tests                 # create test folder
mv src/App.test.js tests/   # move existing react tests away if needed
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
npx playwright install
# add playwright.config.js with testDir set to ./tests
npx playwright test --debug
```

If you want, I can help you create a minimal example Playwright test to verify login flows inside `tests/login.test.ts` once this is fixed—just ask!

# It's creating mess, can you restart from creating a react application and what script should I write ?

To restart cleanly with a React application for your **Samay** assistant login integration and Playwright testing, here is a step-by-step guide from scratch. This creates a minimal React app and a correctly separated Playwright test file to avoid the mess caused by mixing React source files and test runner.

## Step 1: Create a clean React app

If you already created `samay-ui` but want a fresh start, delete or rename the folder and run:

```bash
npx create-react-app samay-ui
cd samay-ui
```

This scaffolds a clean React project with default files (`App.js`, `index.js`, etc.).

## Step 2: Create a separate folder for Playwright tests

Inside `samay-ui`, create a new folder named `tests`:

```bash
mkdir tests
```

This folder will hold your Playwright test files, keeping tests isolated from React source code.

## Step 3: Install Playwright with test runner in your React app

Inside your React app folder (`samay-ui`), run:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```


## Step 4: Create a simple Playwright test for login flow

Inside the newly created `tests` folder, create a file named `login.test.js` (or `.ts` if you prefer TypeScript).

Example minimal template:

```javascript
// tests/login.test.js
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('basic login page loads', async ({ page }) => {
  // Replace URL with the actual login URL of the service you want to test
  await page.goto('https://service-login-url.com/login');

  // Example assertion: check the page has "Sign in" or similar
  await expect(page.locator('text=Sign in')).toBeVisible();
});
```

**Note:** Replace `'https://service-login-url.com/login'` with the actual login page URL for Claude, Gemini, or Perplexity.

## Step 5: Add Playwright config file to specify test directory

In the root of `samay-ui`, add a file `playwright.config.js` with:

```javascript
// playwright.config.js
module.exports = {
  testDir: './tests',     // Only run tests inside the 'tests' folder
  timeout: 60000,
  use: {
    headless: false,      // For debugging, set to true for CI
  },
};
```

This tells Playwright to look only in your `tests` folder and not parse React source code.

## Step 6: Run your Playwright test

Run in your terminal (inside `samay-ui`):

```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

This launches the Playwright test runner in debug mode:

- Opens a browser window
- Runs your `login.test.js` steps
- You can watch it perform actions and assertions

If you want to test multiple services, create separate test files like `login.claude.test.js`, etc.

## Additional Tips

- **Do not put Playwright tests inside `src/`** — keep them in a dedicated folder like `tests/`.
- Make sure files in `src/` are your React app source only.
- Use environment variables or `.env` to store sensitive info (but avoid hardcoding credentials).
- For advanced login flows (Google OAuth, OTP), allow manual interaction or save logged-in sessions for tests.


## Summary of the folder structure

```
samay-ui/
│
├── node_modules/
├── public/
├── src/                # React app source code (App.js, etc.)
│    └── ...
├── tests/              # Playwright test scripts here
│    └── login.test.js
├── package.json
├── playwright.config.js
└── ...
```

If you want, I can help you build simple example React UI components next, or provide sample Playwright scripts for logging into Claude/Gemini/Perplexity based on your preferred login method.

# Resolving the Playwright “Unexpected token '<'” and Test Runner Issues

Your errors—including `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'` and “Playwright Test did not expect test() to be called here”—are caused by a mix of project configuration and test directory/naming issues. Here’s how to fix this reliably:

## 1. Why the Error Occurs

- **The SyntaxError** happens because Playwright’s test runner is picking up your React source files (`App.js`, `App.test.js`) and trying to execute them as tests. These files use JSX or import syntax that Node.js does not understand.
- **Playwright Test did not expect test()** means

<div style="text-align: center">⁂</div>

# How can I fix the "Unexpected token '<'" error in my React app tests

The "Unexpected token '<'" error happens because Jest or Playwright’s test runner tries to parse React component files (`.js` or `.jsx`) containing JSX syntax without proper transformation. JSX code uses angle brackets `<...>`, which plain JavaScript engines can't understand without compilation.

## How to Fix This Error in React App Tests

### 1. **Use Babel or appropriate transformers**

Make sure your test environment compiles JSX and modern JavaScript syntax before running tests.

- **For Jest:**
    - Typically, `create-react-app` already configures this using `react-scripts`, so no action needed.
    - If custom, install Babel preset for React and update Jest config to use it.
- **For Playwright:**
    - Playwright test runner does **not** automatically compile JSX.
    - Do **not** include React source files like `App.js` as test files.
    - Keep your React app source separate from test scripts.


### 2. **Separate Test Code From React Source Code**

- Store your Playwright test scripts **outside** the React `src/` folder, e.g., in a new `tests/` folder at the root level.
- Playwright will then only try running test files with `.test.js/.spec.js` inside that folder, avoiding React code.


### 3. **Configure Playwright to Look in Correct Directory**

Create `playwright.config.js` in your project root with:

```js
module.exports = {
  testDir: './tests',  // Only look in tests folder for test files
};
```


### 4. **Rename or Remove React Unit Test Files Temporarily**

- Rename or move `src/App.test.js` elsewhere to avoid conflicts until Playwright tests are separate.


### 5. **Example Folder Structure**

```
my-react-app/
├── src/
│   ├── App.js           # React app source with JSX
│   ├── index.js
│   └── ...
├── tests/
│   └── login.test.js    # Playwright test scripts here
├── package.json
├── playwright.config.js
└── ...
```


### Summary

- Keep Playwright test scripts outside of React source folders.
- Configure Playwright with `testDir` pointing to tests.
- Ensure JSX is compiled by React scripts, not test runner directly.
- Remove conflicting React tests from Playwright’s search path.

By following these steps, you’ll avoid this error and have a clean testing setup for your Samay assistant project!

# Project Draft: Samay – The Integrated AI Assistant

## Overview

**Samay** is a custom-built, locally-integrated AI assistant designed for MacBook Air M2, focused on privacy, multi-model orchestration, and delivering high-quality research, coding, and productivity support. Its architecture unites best-in-class public assistants (Claude Pro, Gemini Pro, Perplexity Pro) with private local LLMs, optimized for both day-to-day and confidential workflows.

## Project Areas \& Scope

### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration

- Route user input concurrently to Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity.
- Aggregate, validate, and present the best combination of responses.
- Provide a single, unified user workflow—no need to switch between services.


### 2. Local LLM Integration

- Host open-weight Hugging Face LLMs (e.g., Phi-3 Mini, Gemma) for fully private or offline tasks.
- Automatically enforce private processing for confidential files or research papers.


### 3. Research-First Design

- Deep research workflows: structured summarization, automated citation, and report aggregation.
- Support for medium and large-length prompts, adapting context window strategy as needed.


### 4. Modular and Extensible

- Basic UI (desktop app) for launching and controlling all workflows and logins.
- Future-proof for extension with audio, image, video, and IoT/smart device features.


## Project Goals

- **Quality Over Speed:** Ensure the best factual, cited, and structured outputs even at the cost of latency.
- **Privacy by Default:** Local file handling and LLM usage for confidential tasks; never transmit private data to the cloud.
- **Maximum User Control:** Manual override for output review, validation steps, retries, and workflow branching.
- **Unified Long-Term Memory:** Seamless retrieval of prior research, session history, preferences, and local knowledge base.
- **Effortless Integration:** Native browser-based login to all key assistants—no API development or key management for users.


## Samay Will Provide

- Single-login, high-control interface for Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity.
- Parallel prompt dispatch: submit once, get a multi-perspective answer.
- Output validation (checklists, citation presence, completeness), with auto-retry.
- Aggregated markdown/PDF reporting, with sections labeled by assistant/source.
- Manual checkpoints for review, edits, or re-prompting at every step.
- Memory-efficient document chunking for large inputs and research papers.
- Secure file/workspace management using the Mac’s available 95GB storage.
- Modular addition of personal/local LLMs for offline or privacy-centered tasks.


## Features Discussed \& Confirmed

- Multi-modal research intake: accept plain text, uploaded research articles, dataset files.
- Distinct workflows for coding, research, general productivity, or documentation.
- Confidential mode automatically directed to local models.
- Live monitoring and logging of workflow progress, validation status, and retries.
- Storage separation: structured directories for models, logs, reports, memory DB.


## How to Build

### Environment Preparation

- VSCode for development, Node.js, Python (Anaconda), Playwright for browser automation.
- Use Electron or Tauri for desktop app UI; Playwright for login/session handling via browser (no APIs or raw keys).
- Set up folders for models, memory, user data, logs, and workspace organization.


### Core Steps

1. **UI and Integration Foundation**
    - Create a basic desktop app that enables login to all services via browser.
    - Test and confirm session storage works for all accounts and can be reused.
2. **Parallel Prompt Orchestration**
    - Build scripts to send the same query or file to each assistant; collect responses.
    - Implement validation and auto-retry against custom checklists.
3. **Output Processing and Memory Storage**
    - Merge and organize outputs, presenting them in a clear, editable interface.
    - Log session actions, final outputs, and decisions in a local vector DB for retrieval.
4. **Confidential Mode \& Local LLMs**
    - Fingerprint confidential files; route to local models for processing.
    - Maintain full data privacy and compatibility for research needs.
5. **Extensibility \& Evolution**
    - Gradually add features for images, voice, smart device controls, as needs grow.
    - Expand validation rules and report formatting based on use.

## Summary Table

| Area | Key Feature | Implementation Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Orchestration | Parallel prompt to Gemini/Claude/Perplexity | Use multi-thread/process logic |
| Local AI | Private LLMs for confidential docs | Ollama/llama.cpp on-device |
| Validation/Retries | Automated checklist per task | User-configurable |
| Memory | Long-term, searchable local DB | Chroma, SQLite, folder structure |
| UI | Desktop, headless browser logins | Electron/Tauri, Playwright |
