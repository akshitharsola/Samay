ers should *not* run your app component files or your pure React `.js`/`.jsx` source files directly.
- Playwright expects dedicated test files (e.g., `.spec.js`, `.test.js`), not your React components[^18_1][^18_2].

**Resolution:**

- Make sure your tests are placed in a separate `tests/` directory (or wherever Playwright looks for tests).
- Only files that are actual Playwright test scripts should be in your test directory.
- Do **not** reference `App.js`, `.svg`, or `.css` files directly in test scripts unless you are running component tests with correct setup.


## 2. Error: Cannot find module '@playwright/test'

**Cause:**
Your project is missing the Playwright test runner as a development dependency.

**How to fix:**

1. Navigate to your project root (where `package.json` is).
2. Install the Playwright test library:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
```

or, using yarn:

```bash
yarn add --dev @playwright/test
```

3. After installation, ensure that `@playwright/test` is listed in your `devDependencies`.

## 3. Error: No tests found

**Cause:**
Playwright did not discover any valid test files.
This is usually due to one of:

- Incorrect test file naming (test files must end with `.spec.js`, `.test.js`, `.spec.ts`, or `.test.ts` by default)
- Test files are in the wrong directory
- No valid test functions are exported in your test files[^18_3].

**How to fix:**

- Ensure your test scripts are named e.g. `login.test.ts`, `app.spec.js`, and are placed in a `tests/` or `e2e/` directory.
- Confirm your test files actually have valid Playwright test cases:

```javascript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('basic test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Example/);
});
```

- If you’re not using default directories or naming, set the correct test directory in your `playwright.config.ts` file[^18_4].


## 4. Best Practices for Playwright + React Projects

### Correct Folder Structure

```
your-project/
│
├── node_modules/
├── src/                 # React app source code (never run directly as tests)
│    ├── App.js
│    └── ...
├── tests/               # Place your Playwright .test.js/.spec.js files here
│    └── login.test.ts
├── package.json
├── playwright.config.ts # (autogenerated or create this)
```


### Sample Playwright Test (`tests/login.test.ts`)

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('login page works', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://service-url.com/login');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Login/);
});
```


### Install and Initialize Playwright

1. Install Playwright dependencies if not done yet:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

2. Use `npx playwright test` to run all test files in `tests/`.

## References

- Playwright documentation and best practices for folder structure and test setup[^18_5][^18_6][^18_2][^18_4][^18_3][^18_7].


### Next Steps

- Move/remove any `.js` files in `tests/` that aren’t actual Playwright test scripts.
- Install `@playwright/test` as above.
- Verify your test naming and locations.
- After these fixes, run:

```
npx playwright test --debug
```

Your tests should now be recognized and executed properly, and you’ll be able to proceed with UI automation and login checks.

If you hit any specific login automation challenges (Google OAuth, OTP), you can focus your next troubleshooting on just that area.

(samay) akshitharsola@Akshits-MacBook-Air samay-ui %

The error you’re encountering:

```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'
at src/App.js:1
```

typically happens because the test runner (Playwright here) is trying to parse your React source code files (like `App.js`) as if they were plain JavaScript or test scripts, but your React files include JSX and import statements that Node.js doesn’t understand natively.

### Why is this happening?

- Your Playwright test runner is picking up your React app source files (`src/App.js`) or the default React test files (`App.test.js`) as tests.
- Those React files contain JSX syntax (`<` tags) and imports like `import logo from './logo.svg'` which cause syntax errors when run directly in Node.
- Playwright expects dedicated test files written in JS/TS for browser automation (usually inside a separate test folder).


### How to fix this?

1. **Separate your test files from React source code**
    - Make sure your Playwright test scripts live in a separate folder, for example:

```
samay-ui/
  ├── src/               # React app files (App.js, App.css, etc.)
  ├── tests/             # Playwright test scripts here
  │    └── login.test.ts
```

    - Keep your React source files (`App.js`, `App.test.js`) only for app code and React unit tests, not for Playwright tests.
2. **Remove or ignore React test files during Playwright test runs**
    - For Playwright tests, rename or move `src/App.test.js` somewhere else or remove it temporarily.
    - Or configure Playwright to only look for tests inside the `tests/` folder, **not** inside `src/`.
3. **Install Playwright test package properly**

Make sure you installed Playwright’s test runner, which provides the `import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'` syntax.

Run in your project root:

```
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

4. **Create a dedicated Playwright config**

Add a `playwright.config.ts` or `playwright.config.js` at the root with at least:

```js
module.exports = {
  testDir: './tests',        // Tell Playwright to only look here for test files
  timeout: 30000,
};
```

5. **Run Playwright tests from the correct folder**

From your project root, run:

```
npx playwright test --debug
```

This will only run Playwright tests under the `tests/` folder and ignore React sources.

### Summary:

- Your error is because Playwright tries to parse `src/App.js` (which contains JSX) as a test script.
- Isolate Playwright tests from React app source by putting Playwright tests into a separate directory (`tests/`) and set Playwright’s `testDir` to point to it.
- Remove or exclude `src/App.test.js` if you don’t intend to run it with Playwright.
- Ensure you have installed `@playwright/test` and run tests only from the appropriate directory.


### Example steps:

```bash
mkdir tests                 # create test folder
mv src/App.test.js tests/   # move existing react tests away if needed
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
npx playwright install
# add playwright.config.js with testDir set to ./tests
npx playwright test --debug
```

If you want, I can help you create a minimal example Playwright test to verify login flows inside `tests/login.test.ts` once this is fixed—just ask!

# It's creating mess, can you restart from creating a react application and what script should I write ?

To restart cleanly with a React application for your **Samay** assistant login integration and Playwright testing, here is a step-by-step guide from scratch. This creates a minimal React app and a correctly separated Playwright test file to avoid the mess caused by mixing React source files and test runner.

## Step 1: Create a clean React app

If you already created `samay-ui` but want a fresh start, delete or rename the folder and run:

```bash
npx create-react-app samay-ui
cd samay-ui
```

This scaffolds a clean React project with default files (`App.js`, `index.js`, etc.).

## Step 2: Create a separate folder for Playwright tests

Inside `samay-ui`, create a new folder named `tests`:

```bash
mkdir tests
```

This folder will hold your Playwright test files, keeping tests isolated from React source code.

## Step 3: Install Playwright with test runner in your React app

Inside your React app folder (`samay-ui`), run:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```


## Step 4: Create a simple Playwright test for login flow

Inside the newly created `tests` folder, create a file named `login.test.js` (or `.ts` if you prefer TypeScript).

Example minimal template:

```javascript
// tests/login.test.js
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('basic login page loads', async ({ page }) => {
  // Replace URL with the actual login URL of the service you want to test
  await page.goto('https://service-login-url.com/login');

  // Example assertion: check the page has "Sign in" or similar
  await expect(page.locator('text=Sign in')).toBeVisible();
});
```

**Note:** Replace `'https://service-login-url.com/login'` with the actual login page URL for Claude, Gemini, or Perplexity.

## Step 5: Add Playwright config file to specify test directory

In the root of `samay-ui`, add a file `playwright.config.js` with:

```javascript
// playwright.config.js
module.exports = {
  testDir: './tests',     // Only run tests inside the 'tests' folder
  timeout: 60000,
  use: {
    headless: false,      // For debugging, set to true for CI
  },
};
```

This tells Playwright to look only in your `tests` folder and not parse React source code.

## Step 6: Run your Playwright test

Run in your terminal (inside `samay-ui`):

```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

This launches the Playwright test runner in debug mode:

- Opens a browser window
- Runs your `login.test.js` steps
- You can watch it perform actions and assertions

If you want to test multiple services, create separate test files like `login.claude.test.js`, etc.

## Additional Tips

- **Do not put Playwright tests inside `src/`** — keep them in a dedicated folder like `tests/`.
- Make sure files in `src/` are your React app source only.
- Use environment variables or `.env` to store sensitive info (but avoid hardcoding credentials).
- For advanced login flows (Google OAuth, OTP), allow manual interaction or save logged-in sessions for tests.


## Summary of the folder structure

```
samay-ui/
│
├── node_modules/
├── public/
├── src/                # React app source code (App.js, etc.)
│    └── ...
├── tests/              # Playwright test scripts here
│    └── login.test.js
├── package.json
├── playwright.config.js
└── ...
```

If you want, I can help you build simple example React UI components next, or provide sample Playwright scripts for logging into Claude/Gemini/Perplexity based on your preferred login method.

Let me know how you want to proceed!

# Resolving the Playwright “Unexpected token '<'” and Test Runner Issues

Your errors—including `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'` and “Playwright Test did not expect test() to be called here”—are caused by a mix of project configuration and test directory/naming issues. Here’s how to fix this reliably:

## 1. Why the Error Occurs

- **The SyntaxError** happens because Playwright’s test runner is picking up your React source files (`App.js`, `App.test.js`) and trying to execute them as tests. These files use JSX or import syntax that Node.js does not understand.
- **Playwright Test did not expect test()** means

# How can I fix the "Unexpected token '<'" error in my React app tests

The "Unexpected token '<'" error happens because Jest or Playwright’s test runner tries to parse React component files (`.js` or `.jsx`) containing JSX syntax without proper transformation. JSX code uses angle brackets `<...>`, which plain JavaScript engines can't understand without compilation.

## How to Fix This Error in React App Tests

### 1. **Use Babel or appropriate transformers**

Make sure your test environment compiles JSX and modern JavaScript syntax before running tests.

- **For Jest:**
    - Typically, `create-react-app` already configures this using `react-scripts`, so no action needed.
    - If custom, install Babel preset for React and update Jest config to use it.
- **For Playwright:**
    - Playwright test runner does **not** automatically compile JSX.
    - Do **not** include React source files like `App.js` as test files.
    - Keep your React app source separate from test scripts.


### 2. **Separate Test Code From React Source Code**

- Store your Playwright test scripts **outside** the React `src/` folder, e.g., in a new `tests/` folder at the root level.
- Playwright will then only try running test files with `.test.js/.spec.js` inside that folder, avoiding React code.


### 3. **Configure Playwright to Look in Correct Directory**

Create `playwright.config.js` in your project root with:

```js
module.exports = {
  testDir: './tests',  // Only look in tests folder for test files
};
```


### 4. **Rename or Remove React Unit Test Files Temporarily**

- Rename or move `src/App.test.js` elsewhere to avoid conflicts until Playwright tests are separate.


### 5. **Example Folder Structure**

```
my-react-app/
├── src/
│   ├── App.js           # React app source with JSX
│   ├── index.js
│   └── ...
├── tests/
│   └── login.test.js    # Playwright test scripts here
├── package.json
├── playwright.config.js
└── ...
```


### Summary

- Keep Playwright test scripts outside of React source folders.
- Configure Playwright with `testDir` pointing to tests.
- Ensure JSX is compiled by React scripts, not test runner directly.
- Remove conflicting React tests from Playwright’s search path.

By following these steps, you’ll avoid this error and have a clean testing setup for your Samay assistant project!

# Project Draft: Samay – The Integrated AI Assistant

## Overview

**Samay** is a custom-built, locally-integrated AI assistant designed for MacBook Air M2, focused on privacy, multi-model orchestration, and delivering high-quality research, coding, and productivity support. Its architecture unites best-in-class public assistants (Claude Pro, Gemini Pro, Perplexity Pro) with private local LLMs, optimized for both day-to-day and confidential workflows.

## Project Areas \& Scope

### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration

- Route user input concurrently to Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity.
- Aggregate, validate, and present the best combination of responses.
- Provide a single, unified user workflow—no need to switch between services.


### 2. Local LLM Integration

- Host open-weight Hugging Face LLMs (e.g., Phi-3 Mini, Gemma) for fully private or offline tasks.
- Automatically enforce private processing for confidential files or research papers.


### 3. Research-First Design

- Deep research workflows: structured summarization, automated citation, and report aggregation.
- Support for medium and large-length prompts, adapting context window strategy as needed.


### 4. Modular and Extensible

- Basic UI (desktop app) for launching and controlling all workflows and logins.
- Future-proof for extension with audio, image, video, and IoT/smart device features.


## Project Goals

- **Quality Over Speed:** Ensure the best factual, cited, and structured outputs even at the cost of latency.
- **Privacy by Default:** Local file handling and LLM usage for confidential tasks; never transmit private data to the cloud.
- **Maximum User Control:** Manual override for output review, validation steps, retries, and workflow branching.
- **Unified Long-Term Memory:** Seamless retrieval of prior research, session history, preferences, and local knowledge base.
- **Effortless Integration:** Native browser-based login to all key assistants—no API development or key management for users.


## Samay Will Provide

- Single-login, high-control interface for Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity.
- Parallel prompt dispatch: submit once, get a multi-perspective answer.
- Output validation (checklists, citation presence, completeness), with auto-retry.
- Aggregated markdown/PDF reporting, with sections labeled by assistant/source.
- Manual checkpoints for review, edits, or re-prompting at every step.
- Memory-efficient document chunking for large inputs and research papers.
- Secure file/workspace management using the Mac’s available 95GB storage.
- Modular addition of personal/local LLMs for offline or privacy-centered tasks.


## Features Discussed \& Confirmed

- Multi-modal research intake: accept plain text, uploaded research articles, dataset files.
- Distinct workflows for coding, research, general productivity, or documentation.
- Confidential mode automatically directed to local models.
- Live monitoring and logging of workflow progress, validation status, and retries.
- Storage separation: structured directories for models, logs, reports, memory DB.


## How to Build

### Environment Preparation

- VSCode for development, Node.js, Python (Anaconda), Playwright for browser automation.
- Use Electron or Tauri for desktop app UI; Playwright for login/session handling via browser (no APIs or raw keys).
- Set up folders for models, memory, user data, logs, and workspace organization.


### Core Steps

1. **UI and Integration Foundation**
    - Create a basic desktop app that enables login to all services via browser.
    - Test and confirm session storage works for all accounts and can be reused.
2. **Parallel Prompt Orchestration**
    - Build scripts to send the same query or file to each assistant; collect responses.
    - Implement validation and auto-retry against custom checklists.
3. **Output Processing and Memory Storage**
    - Merge and organize outputs, presenting them in a clear, editable interface.
    - Log session actions, final outputs, and decisions in a local vector DB for retrieval.
4. **Confidential Mode \& Local LLMs**
    - Fingerprint confidential files; route to local models for processing.
    - Maintain full data privacy and compatibility for research needs.
5. **Extensibility \& Evolution**
    - Gradually add features for images, voice, smart device controls, as needs grow.
    - Expand validation rules and report formatting based on use.

## Summary Table

| Area | Key Feature | Implementation Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Orchestration | Parallel prompt to Gemini/Claude/Perplexity | Use multi-thread/process logic |
| Local AI | Private LLMs for confidential docs | Ollama/llama.cpp on-device |
| Validation/Retries | Automated checklist per task | User-configurable |
| Memory | Long-term, searchable local DB | Chroma, SQLite, folder structure |
| UI | Desktop, headless browser logins | Electron/Tauri, Playwright |
| Privacy | File tagging \& automatic routing | Scripted rules, user toggles |

**Samay** will unify the power of multiple AI agents while upholding privacy, flexibility, and transparency, making it a robust, personal AI partner for research, coding, and productivity on your MacBook Air M2.
