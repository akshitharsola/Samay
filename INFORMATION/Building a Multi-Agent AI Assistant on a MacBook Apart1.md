# Building a Multi-Agent AI Assistant on a MacBook Air M2

_Free Hugging Face LLMs + Claude Code + Local Apple Silicon GPU_

The following guide how to architect, install, program, and extend a personal “Jarvis-style” assistant that mediates between you and Anthropic’s Claude coding model while also handling day-to-day tasks locally. All components are chosen to run at zero or near-zero cost on a MacBook Air M2 and to remain vendor-agnostic by using open-source models from Hugging Face and LangChain’s multi-agent framework.

## Overview

Modern Apple Silicon laptops can host 4-bit-quantized 3 B–8 B language models entirely on-device, while heavier reasoning or code-generation turns can be off-loaded to Claude through a lightweight proxy service. By chaining these pieces into a supervisors-and-workers graph, you obtain:

- A free, locally running “brain” for fast queries and offline work (e.g., Phi-3-Mini, Gemma-2B, Mistral-7B in Q4) [^1_1][^1_2][^1_3].
- A cloud bridge that rewrites your natural-language programming intentions into concise, machine-readable prompts for Claude, then post-processes the API response for readability [^1_4][^1_5][^1_6].
- Tool wrappers (shell, Spotlight, browser automation, HomeKit, etc.) registered as LangChain agents so your assistant can execute macOS actions on command [^1_7][^1_8].

The result is an extensible, multi-persona system that costs <\$3 month in Claude API calls under typical hobbyist usage and nothing when fully offline.

## Hardware \& OS Baseline

### MacBook Air M2 specs (relevant excerpts)

| Component | Key figures |
| :-- | :-- |
| CPU / GPU | 8-core CPU, 8- or 10-core GPU  [^1_9] |
| Neural Engine | 16-core [^1_9] |
| Unified Memory | 8 GB default; up to 24 GB  [^1_9] |
| Memory BW | 100 GB/s [^1_9] |

A 7 GB quantized GGUF file such as Mistral-7B-Q4_0 sits comfortably in 8 GB RAM when you off-load ≥1 layer to the 8-core GPU via Metal [^1_10][^1_11]. If you own the 16 GB or 24 GB configuration, an 8 B or even 14 B model runs entirely in RAM without swap [^1_12][^1_13].

## Selecting Free Hugging Face LLMs

| Model family | Params | Context | Quant Size (Q4 _K_M) | Strengths | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Phi-3-Mini | 3.8 B | 4,096 tokens [^1_1][^1_14] | 2.1 GB | Reasoning benchmarks; small RAM | Ideal default brain |
| Gemma-2B | 2.5 B effective [^1_15] | 8,192 tokens [^1_2] | 1.4 GB | Fast, open-weights, safety tooling [^1_16] | Use for quick lookups |
| Mistral-7B Instruct | 7.0 B | 4,096 tokens [^1_3] | 4.4 GB | Conversational fluency | Needs 8 GB+ RAM |
| Llama-3 8B | 8.03 B [^1_17] | 8,192 tokens [^1_18] | 4.7 GB | High-quality reasoning | 16 GB RAM recommended |

All four are license-permissive and have free inference quotas via Hugging Face TGI or serverless endpoints [^1_19][^1_20].

## Local Serving on Apple Silicon

1. **Install llama.cpp**:

```bash
brew install ggml-org/llama.cpp/llama.cpp  # auto-enables Metal GPU
```

_(Brew build uses `GGML_METAL=ON` by default [^1_21])_.
2. **Download a Q4 model**:

```bash
ollama run phi3:mini-4k
```

Ollama bundles Metal acceleration and acts as an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server [^1_22][^1_13].
3. **Run as a background service**:

```bash
ollama serve
export OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
```

4. **Benchmark**: Expect 12–18 tokens s⁻¹ on an 8 core GPU for Phi-3 and 6–9 tokens s⁻¹ for Mistral-7B Q4 [^1_23][^1_11].

## Remote Fallback: Claude 3.5 Sonnet

Claude 3.5 Sonnet exposes a 200 k token context window (inputs) and 4,096 token generation limit (outputs) [^1_24][^1_25]. The first \$5 credit is free after SMS verification [^1_6]. Add a request header to unlock 8,192 output tokens:

```http
POST /v1/messages
anthropic-beta: max-tokens-3-5-sonnet-2024-07-15
```

_Work-around avoids the older 4,096 validator bug in AWS Bedrock [^1_26][^1_27]._

Pricing at \$3 M⁻¹ input tokens and \$15 M⁻¹ output tokens means a 1,000-token round-trip costs ≈\$0.018.

## System Architecture

### High-level Graph (LangGraph notation)

```mermaid
graph TD
  U(User) --> R(Resident LLM)
  U -->|Code request| P(Proxy Agent)
  R -->|Fast answer OR delegate| P
  P -->|Rewrite prompt| C(Claude API)
  C --> P
  P -->|Post-process| R
  R --> U
  R -.tool.->|macOS actions| T(Toolbox)
```

1. **Resident LLM** (Phi-3) handles small talk, offline Q\&A, and writes chain-of-thought stubs [^1_14][^1_13].
2. **Proxy Agent** rewrites high-level coding requests into terse “machine language” for Claude [^1_4][^1_8].
3. **Claude** returns compilable code; the proxy strips escape sequences and feeds back to the resident model for summarization [^1_5][^1_6].
4. **Toolbox** exposes shell, Spotlight, Automator, HomeKit, and Browser methods as JSON-schema tools callable via LangChain’s ReAct agent [^1_7][^1_8].

## Prompt Engineering Blueprint

| Phase | System prompt snippet | Purpose |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Resident LLM | “You are Swift-Lite, a fast offline assistant. For large code or deep reasoning, reply ONLY with `DELEGATE:` + a one-sentence summary.” | Triggers routing |
| Proxy Agent → Claude | “Act as a senior macOS developer. Translate the user story into minimal, well-commented Swift code. Respond with triple-back-ticked blocks only.” | Clairity |
| Claude → Proxy | N/A (Claude’s output) | Code + |
| chain-of-thought remains hidden |  |  |
| Proxy → Resident | `CODE:` followed by cleaned code; `SUMMARY:` concise explainer | Consistent UI |

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Python environment

```bash
brew install pyenv && pyenv install 3.11.9
pyenv virtualenv 3.11.9 jarvis-env
pyenv activate jarvis-env
pip install langchain langgraph langchain_huggingface langchain_anthropic llama-cpp-python[server] ollama
```

`llama-cpp-python` v0.1.68 adds Metal GPU by default [^1_10].

### 2. Load local model

```python
from langchain_community.llms import LlamaCpp
llm_local = LlamaCpp(
    model_path="~/Library/Application Support/ollama/models/phi3-mini-4k.Q4_K_M.gguf",
    n_gpu_layers=1,
    n_ctx=4096,
    temperature=0.3,
)
```


### 3. Define Claude client

```python
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
llm_claude = ChatAnthropic(
    model_name="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
    anthropic_api_key=os.getenv("CLAUDE_KEY"),
    extra_headers={"anthropic-beta": "max-tokens-3-5-sonnet-2024-07-15"},
)
```


### 4. Build LangGraph router

```python
import langgraph

def route(node_state):
    if node_state["text"].startswith("DELEGATE:"):
        return "proxy"
    return "resident"

graph = langgraph.Graph()
graph.add_node("resident", llm_local)
graph.add_node("proxy", llm_claude)
graph.set_entry_point("resident")
graph.add_edge("resident", route)
graph.add_edge("proxy", "resident")
assistant = graph.compile()
```


### 5. Register macOS tools

```python
from langchain.tools import Tool
import subprocess, webbrowser, os, json

def open_url(url:str):
    webbrowser.open(url)
    return "Opened " + url

def run_shell(cmd:str):
    out = subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True, text=True)
    return out[:2_000]

tools = [
    Tool.from_function(run_shell, name="shell", description="Run safe shell commands"),
    Tool.from_function(open_url, name="browser", description="Open a URL"),
]
```

Attach tools to the graph via ReAct [^1_7].

## Voice I/O (Optional)

- **STT**: Use Apple Speech framework via `pyobjc` for offline dictation.
- **TTS**: `say` CLI or Apple Neural TTS for multilingual output.
- Connect microphone events to `assistant.invoke()`; stream responses through TTS.


## Persistence \& Memory

1. **Short-term**: LangChain’s `ConversationBufferMemory` keeps the last N interactions in RAM.
2. **Long-term facts**: Store embeddings in SQLite using `duckdb + pgvector` or `Chroma` referencing user notes.
3. **Code base context**: Claude already handles 200 k tokens; for local models, chunk files and feed on demand.

## Security \& Privacy

- Keep Claude API key in macOS Keychain.
- Gate any `shell` or `sudo` call behind an explicit user confirmation prompt via SwiftDialog.
- Add ShieldGemma classifiers locally to screen user inputs and model outputs for policy violations [^1_16].


## Cost \& Performance Table

| Operation | Local tokens | Time (M2 8-core GPU) | Claude tokens | Cloud cost |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Quick Q\&A | 50 | 0.25 s | 0 | \$0 |
| Medium explanation | 300 | 2 s | 0 | \$0 |
| Code generation | 200 deleg. | 1 s rewrite + 3 s Claude | 1,200 | \$0.018 [^1_6] |
| Full project scaffold | 1,000 deleg. | 3 s + 12 s Claude | 5,000 | \$0.09 |

At <50 k Claude tokens per month, total bill ≈\$0.75.

## Testing Matrix

| Scenario | Expected Router | Pass criteria |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| “What’s 7 × 13?” | Local | <0.5 s answer |
| “Generate a SwiftUI view for a login screen.” | Proxy → Claude | Compilable code |
| “Open apple.com” | Local + tool call | Browser launches |
| “Shut down in 15 min” | Local + shell | Schedules `shutdown -h +15` |

## Common Pitfalls \& Fixes

| Symptom | Likely cause | Remedy |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| “Cannot mmap model” | Not enough RAM | Use Phi-3 Mini Q4 or off-load fewer GPU layers |
| Claude error “max_tokens 4096” | Missing header | Add `anthropic-beta` header [^1_26] |
| Tool hallucinations | ReAct agent lacks outcome checks | Add guardrails that parse tool JSON and validate fields |
| Slow local decoding | Default `n_gpu_layers=0` | Set `n_gpu_layers=1` or more [^1_10] |

## Extending the Assistant

1. **GitOps**: Integrate `gitpython` tool for commit, push, PR creation.
2. **HomeKit**: Expose JSON tool to call `pyhap` for smart-home control.
3. **RAG**: Add directory-watcher that chunks PDF/Markdown into Chroma and routes queries to a retrieval-augmented chain.
4. **Vision**: Pipe clipboard images through Phi-3-Vision or Claude-Vision once released.

## Conclusion

By pairing a lightweight on-device brain (Phi-3, Gemma, or Mistral) with a specialized cloud coder (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and orchestrating them through LangGraph, you achieve a responsive, privacy-respecting personal assistant on a MacBook Air M2. The workflow combines zero-cost local inference, GPU acceleration via Metal, and pay-as-you-go heavy lifting only when needed. With modular agents and Hugging Face’s ever-growing catalog of free models, your 2025 “Jarvis” evolves as quickly as the open-source ecosystem itself.

## Insights on a More Intelligent "Jarvis" Workflow for Claude Pro Users

Your vision—where your assistant mediates with Claude, detects unsatisfactory results, and intelligently retries or clarifies—reflects a new level of automation and quality control in AI-powered work. Below are some key thoughts and conceptual building blocks for such an assistant, with a focus on information and design rather than implementation:

### 1. **Automated Output Validation and Feedback Loop**

- The assistant can act as a *reviewer* of Claude’s output by:
    - Comparing the actual response against your explicitly stated requirements or expected format.
    - Automatically identifying missing elements, discrepancies in content, or incorrect structures.
    - Triggering additional queries to Claude that clarify, refine, or complete the original output until the desired standard is achieved.
- This "auto-retry" loop bridges the gap between your intent and the model’s first response, potentially reducing back-and-forth and manual editing.


### 2. **Structured Communication Layer**

- Before forwarding your request to Claude, the assistant can:
    - Parse and formalize your instructions (inputs, expected outputs, formatting rules, constraints).
    - Generate a detailed checklist or structured rubric that both Claude and itself use to evaluate completeness and accuracy.
- This structure can be customized based on the context (e.g., code generation, explanations, project management tasks).


### 3. **Personalized Context and Intent Awareness**

- The assistant can leverage previous interactions, your preferred coding or work style, and domain knowledge to:
    - Remind Claude (or itself in local processing) of recurring mistakes or preferences.
    - Adapt its evaluation criteria based on the type of task—e.g., code correctness, answer exhaustiveness, adherence to a particular programming paradigm.


### 4. **Fail-over and Self-improvement Routines**

- If repeated attempts with Claude don’t yield satisfactory results, the assistant can:
    - Highlight persistent gaps and suggest alternative ways to frame the request.
    - Offer to try local model inference (for basic tasks), seek information from external sources, or initiate a human feedback loop.


### 5. **Generalized Multimodal Support**

- Beyond coding, this assistant paradigm can be extended to other tasks:
    - Automating file management, search, and retrieval.
    - Managing day-to-day workflows (meetings, notes, reminders) by applying similar request-response validation cycles.
    - Handling voice commands, images, and smart device actions with the same review/retry logic.


### 6. **Transparency and User-in-the-Loop Controls**

- Throughout each step, the assistant should keep you informed of:
    - What was checked versus your specs.
    - What is missing or ambiguous.
    - What is being retried or escalated.
- At any point, you can override, accept, or refine its judgment, maintaining ultimate authority over decisions and outputs.

**In summary:**
A "Jarvis"-style assistant not only serves as a conduit between you and Claude Pro, but also becomes a true co-pilot—formalizing your intent, reviewing Claude's work, performing iterative refinements, and extending these practices to all AI-assisted workflows. By adding layers of context-awareness, validation, and automation, the assistant can offer both higher productivity and greater reliability across many personal and professional tasks.
