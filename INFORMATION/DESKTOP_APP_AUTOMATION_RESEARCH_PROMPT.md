   ```python
   class DesktopServiceManager:
       def detect_installed_apps(self) -> Dict[str, bool]:
           # Check which AI service desktop apps are installed
           pass
       
       def initialize_service(self, service: str) -> bool:
           # Launch and prepare desktop app for automation
           pass
   ```

2. **Desktop Automation Wrapper:**
   ```python
   class DesktopAppAutomator:
       def send_prompt(self, app_name: str, prompt: str) -> str:
           # Generic desktop app automation interface
           pass
       
       def extract_response(self, app_name: str) -> str:
