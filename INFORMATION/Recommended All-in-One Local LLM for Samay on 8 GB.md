# Recommended All-in-One Local LLM for Samay on 8 GB MacBook Air M2

**Main Takeaway:**
With only 8 GB of RAM, the local model for your **multi-agent, all-purpose assistant** is **Phi-3-Mini-4K-Instruct (quantized Q4_K_M)**. It balances reasoning, code generation, summarization, and conversational tasks within a ~2.2 GB memory footprint, leaving enough headroom for the OS and orchestration processes.

## Why Phi-3-Mini-4K-Instruct?

1. **Multi-Task Capability**
    - Scores highly across reasoning, language understanding, and code benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval 57.3% 0-shot, GSM8K 85.7% CoT)[^1].
    - Instruction-tuned for diverse workflows: summarization, Q\&A, code, and chat.
2. **Memory Efficiency**
    - Quantized Q4_K_M GGUF size: ~2.2 GB[^2].
    - Leaves ~5–6 GB free for system processes, orchestration layers, local caching, and your Python runtime.
3. **Performance on M2 Air (8 GB)**
    - Benchmarks and community reports confirm ~5–8 tokens/sec on M2 Air with Metal acceleration, enabling interactive response times for most tasks[^3].
    - Significantly faster and more reliable than heavier models like Mistral-7B Q4_0, which on 8 GB often stalls at ~1 token/sec and risks out-of-memory errors[^4].
4. **Instruction Following \& Refinement**
    - Optimized for follow-up prompts and iterative refinement, critical for your middle-man orchestration (taking cloud outputs, checking, and re-prompting).

## Deployment Recommendations

1. **Install Ollama \& Pull Model**

```bash
brew install ollama
ollama pull microsoft/phi3-mini-4k-instruct
```

2. **Run with Metal GPU**

```bash
ollama run phi3-mini-4k-instruct --gpu
```

– Enjoy 5–8 tokens/sec interactive speed on M2 Air.
3. **Integrate into Samay Orchestrator**
    - **Local “Resident” Agent:** Route all confidential and refinement tasks to Phi-3-Mini first.
    - **Cloud Proxy Agent:** Delegate heavy code-analysis or long-context chunks to Claude/Gemini/Perplexity as needed.
    - **Validation \& Retry:** Use your validation layer to compare Phi-3 outputs, re-issue sub-prompts, or selectively upgrade to cloud LLM for deeper reasoning.
4. **Memory Management**
    - Limit simultaneous concurrent sessions: only one Phi-3 instance per process.
    - Off-load secondary layers (e.g., chunking, retrieval embedding) to disk-based vector store (Chroma/SQLite) rather than RAM.

## Summary Table

| Criterion | Phi-3-Mini-4K-Instruct | Gemma-2B | Mistral-7B Q4_0 |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| RAM Footprint | ~2.2 GB (Q4_K_M) | ~1.4 GB (Q4_K_M) | ~4.4 GB (Q4_0) |
| Tokens/sec (M2 Air 8 GB) | 5–8 t/s[^3] | ~10 t/s | ~1 t/s[^4] |
| Reasoning \& Benchmarks | Strong across MMLU, BigBench CoT[^1] | Moderate | Good but slow on 8 GB |
| Instruction-Tuned | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Code Generation (HumanEval) | 57.3% | 34.1% | 28.0% |
| Overall Suitability | **High** (balanced, versatile) | Medium (fast lookups) | Low (too heavy for 8 GB) |

By choosing **Phi-3-Mini-4K-Instruct**, Samay gains a **versatile, on-device brain** capable of handling most local tasks—summarization, refinement, conversational orchestration—while still leaving room to orchestrate Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity as specialized “proxy” agents when deeper or citation-backed outputs are required.
